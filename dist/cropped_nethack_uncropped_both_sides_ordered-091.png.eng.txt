Tietje decided to engage in full-scale combat.

She took off the braid that was holding her bangs up and held it in her right hand. This gold diadem was to be used to enter the cave.
This gold hair ornament was a gift from a male child the day before she entered the cave. You will have to try to fold the sixth one.
(6) I know I can't unlock the door with my darts, even if I don't try to break the second one. We need something softer, like a wire.
I need something like a softer wire.
Sorry, Mr. Fillian.

Tiket inserted the soft wire into the keyhole.

After a few moments, she finally gave up. The pure gold pin of the hair ornament in her hand was nothing.
The pure gold pin in her hand was bent and no longer served its intended purpose.

The talker's bird's-eye view of the station, the l-stripping of the bird's tail, and the removal of the bird's tail from its body.

Tchaiké threw the treasure chest to the wind. The sound of thumping, indicating the presence of the objects inside, was heard.
The thumping sound that indicated the presence of the objects inside was annoying. Michael, who had fallen asleep beside Teeke, woke up.
Mykel, who had been sleeping beside Teeke, woke up and mewed, "Meow!

Tiket sat up with a tired look on his face. She picked up her backpack.
She picks up the backpack and walks toward the door at the back of the room. He has left the jamming ornaments by the treasure chest.
The obstruction has been discarded by the treasure chest.

He puts his hand on the door's hook, but it doesn't budge.

(Is there a key here, too?)

Anger welled up in Tätike's heart. He steps back and takes a deep breath.
(2) Step back and take a deep breath.

HATHET

(2) Kick forward with energy.

With a loud sound, the door is blown open as if torn from its spiral.

Tzike is not good at memorizing hymns, but he is second to none in physical training.
She has never been better at physical training.

Feeling a little better, Tätike tried to leave the room, but something was bothering her. But something was bothering her.
Something was bothering her.

Teeke couldn't help but exclaim: "I don't need to unlock the treasure chest. There was no need to unlock the treasure chest.
