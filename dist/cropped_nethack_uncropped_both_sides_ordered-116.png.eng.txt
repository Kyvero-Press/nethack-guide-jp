I pulled a piece of gnawed oak meat out of the backpack and "flicked it in front of him.
I let him try it on me. He was growling, but clearly paying attention to the meat.
I could see that he was paying attention to the meat.

The black dog was a little lost. The black dog was a little confused, but his hunger got the better of him.
He ate the meat.
The black dog was a little confused, but his hunger got the better of him and he ate the meat.

The black dog did not seem to pay any attention to the voice of the man who was eating the meat, and continued to eat. The black dog was completely oblivious to his presence.
The black dog seemed to be completely oblivious to his presence.

Yoshine shrugged her shoulders and left the room. If she couldn't get used to it, then she wouldn't be able to do it.
If she couldn't get used to him, it would be dangerous for her to stay with him. But that is not the case.
But he could not let the black dog go into his hands. If he did, he would have to leave.
He would have to leave.

In the darkness of the hallway, several arrows flew out. Most of them were shot with his crystal platemail.

But already a monster silhouette was emerging from the darkness. A half-human, half-horse figure appeared at .......
Khentauros! What brings you to the demon cave of Yender? Kentaus!

The Kentaurs are a tribe that originally inhabited the steppes and mountains. Even though the Yender's cave is large, he is not a member of the Khentauroz race.

That moment of hesitation leads to Kentaulus' powerful kick to Yoshitane's torso.
Frame 2.

All of the air in her lungs is expelled, and she cannot breathe at all. I can't even breathe.
The eyes are blurred and consciousness drifts through the air.

In the corner of my vision, I saw the hoof of a kentaur. But Yoshitane couldn't even pull out his katana.
Yoshikine could not even pull out her katana.

I Taku Ubukata

The moment Josine's consciousness screamed out from somewhere else.
