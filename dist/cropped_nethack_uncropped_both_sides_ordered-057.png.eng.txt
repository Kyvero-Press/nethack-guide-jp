The first time I saw the two hands, I was surprised to see them. The hand that was supposed to be holding the katana had turned into a clenched fist.
The hand that was supposed to be holding Katana had become a clenched fist.

However, when he looked around, he saw that Katana was not the only one who had disappeared.

The child, the dragon hand, and even the crystalline platemail he had worked so hard to obtain were gone.
The only thing that remained was a preventative measure. The only protective gear that remained was a pair of boots up to the knees. The back pack-back was gone.
Even the puck back had become light.
I see... I've met Kink.

Perhaps with a little effort, Jositne slumped to the floor. I couldn't regret it.
He was so sorry that he couldn't even regret it.

Nymphs, whose beauty has been celebrated in countless sculptures, paintings, and poems, are a symbol of the world's most beautiful people.
The highest form of beauty is the art of the artist. Women with the highest qualities of beauty, conscious of their own beauty, disciplined to the utmost limits, and with a strong sense of self-worth, are the most important people in the world today.
Even if a woman with the highest qualities of beauty is aware of her own beauty and trains herself to the utmost limit, she will never be able to match the magical beauty of the nymphs.
Nymph's beauty is not to be found in the written word. The beauty of the Nymphs is beyond description, and no carving, no painting, no drawing, no painting can match their beauty.
No sculpture, painting, or poem can compare to the beauty of a nymph.

The survey was very beautiful.

Yoshitsune was charmed by the girl at the first sight of her. Not even an eyebrow moved.
She could not move an eyebrow, nor did she allow the mischievous Nymph to take his katana or remove his helmet.
He allowed the naughty nymph to take his katana, to remove his helmet, and to pull the dragon's hand from his arm. No, I had to forgive him.
I could not.

"Ah!"

Josine sighed heavily.

We have to find out what was stolen. ....... ]

He muttered to himself in a monologue that had become his habit ever since he had entered the cave.

I tried to examine the contents of the backpack while muttering a few words that have become a habit of mine since I entered the grotto.
