Nasrullah shook his head. It was something they didn't teach us at the orphanage.

The bell is the cupola made of dragon scales. The bell is made of dragon scales.
It is much harder than those bells. It is much harder than the bells made from the scales of dragons.
They are the strongest. It's the strongest of all.

I didn't know that.

The talk of "I wanted to be the best.

I guess you're right. Few people have ever seen the Dragon's stirrups. In the old days, the prophet king, Bai'ari, was the king of the ring.
