On a hunch, Nasrullah moves his finger.

Nasrullah felt the touch of a medicine bottle on the tip of his finger. The corner of the unicorn was below it.

But that was all. Nasrullah could no longer move his fingers.
Nasrullah could no longer move her finger. The monster was looking down at her.

She had no idea who the monster was. But no matter how weak the monster was, she could not see it now.
But no matter how weak the monster is, it is a more formidable enemy than the dragon.

(Until the end of time? )

She, too, has come to her senses.

However, contrary to her expectations, there was no attack. The monster in question was seen as an adventurer.
The monster saw us as an enemy and attacked us without hesitation. Let it be by the sword or by the fangs.
The monster was not a monster without a sword or fangs.

(If you are interested in ...... )

The monster may be lost. The monster may be lost.
The monster may think that the motionless adventurer is dead. Except for monsters like jackals, which feed on dead bodies, the dead are not considered dead.
No one except monsters that feed on dead bodies, such as the jakkals, would take a dead body as a partner. And a monster with intelligence, such as an elf, would not be a good partner for a dead body.

Nasrullah did not move an inch. He could not inhale, let alone breathe, and every muscle in his body stopped moving.
Every muscle in his body stopped moving, let alone breathing. He took advantage of his immobility and pretended to be dead.
LES W30k,

Nasrullah's bet paid off. The monster was watching her closely,
But finally he left.

Again, Nasrullah moved his finger. Something hard touched her fingertips.
(Zau3)

She grabbed it reflexively and pulled it out in a single motion. (Zau3) She grabbed it reflexively and pulled it away.
(Zau3) She forcefully lifted her arm and clamped it against her forehead. Because of the lack of full sensation in his hand, the tip of the antler stuck in his finger.
The tip of the antler was sticking into his finger because he could not fully feel his hand. He found that his paralysis was so severe that he felt no pain at all.
The tip of the antler was stuck in his finger. However, what he pulled out was definitely a unicorn horn.

Nasrullah felt the horns of the unicorn absorb the paralysis itself.
Nasrullah felt the numbness itself being absorbed. At the same time, his fingers began to ache.

(I can do it.)

She grabbed her sword and stood up. The monster turned around and looked at her.
