NETHACK GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
(Copyright 1989 M. Stephenson)

(Based on the BISON general public license,
copyright 1988 Richard M. Stallman)

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license,
but changing it is not allowed. You can also use this wording to make the
terms for other programs.

The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy
of those companies. By contrast, our general public license is intended to give
everyone the right to share NetHack. To make sure that you get the rights
we want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. Hence this license

agreement.

Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away
copies of NetHack, that you receive source code or else can get it if you want
it, that you can change NetHack or use pieces of it in new free programs, and
that you know you can do these things.

To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights. For example, if you distribute copies of
NetHack, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must
tell them their rights.

Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out
that there is no warranty for NetHack. If NetHack is modified by someone
else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not
what we distributed.

Therefore we (Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights)
make the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to
distribute or change NetHack.
