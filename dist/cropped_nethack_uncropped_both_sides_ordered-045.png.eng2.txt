It was the first time Tike had experienced a sensation so pleasurable that it made him shiver.

A violent revelry that arose from the depths of his body attacked Tike's consciousness.
In a dream, I kept shouting words that made no sense to me.

Tyke suddenly abandoned Kaun.

I reached out my hand to the pile of clothes that was in Changyuan, and looked at the spell book that had fallen next to it.
The line stops.

That guy came when I was trying to memorize this spell book.

A humanoid monster called an incubus.

As I was trying to concentrate my mind to remember a new spell, Tyke approached me from behind.
I didn't notice the incubus that had arrived. Yes, all the doors in the room are closed.
Since I don't have a lot of money in the DO library, most people are crazy about it.
If it is a hand, you will notice right away where the first blow was taken and you will be able to counterattack.
I can hear it.

However, Rain Cuba did not attack Tyke, but instead charmed him.

As he was told, Tike threw away his weapon, put his arm in the stirrup, and...

Biting his lip, Tyke stood up.

Without saying a word, I put on my shirt and picked up the panned mail from the floor.
Strangely, I felt like my body was becoming lighter. The phochu I ate a long time ago
The Incubus kills the person it likes and uses the paper that was in the Incubus cookie.
It says, ``I will give power to those who like me.'' I wonder if that is true?
That's what Tike was thinking as he put on his stirrups.

He strapped the shield around his left arm and lowered the mace to his waist. I searched for a spring and sank my body into it.
B. ⑧ There are some cases where you have to go bald.

After locking both of the two doors in the city hall with the wand, I opened the door.
He sat straight on the floor. I placed the spellbook I had just started reading on my lap.

The following is written on the cover of the spellbook in gold letters:

“Fin bottom r of f de th”

That incubus is probably still somewhere on this floor.

I will definitely find it and use this spell to exact revenge.
