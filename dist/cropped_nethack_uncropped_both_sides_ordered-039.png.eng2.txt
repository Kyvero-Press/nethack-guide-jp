I took a sip of the tea I had prepared. He took a sip and let out a small sigh.

``Today was the day we went to the devil's cave...how many of you were there?''

The chief asked a woman standing nearby. For them, it is a daily conversation.

As she brushed her long hair, she looked at the sheepskin paper that had Katsura on it.

``Today, ④ people went to work. The Samurai and the Priest, The Valkyrie and the Thief
There are ① people each. Still, not a single person has come out. This morning, I chose from the devil's cave.
① There are many people who can do it. Of course, I didn't have an amulet.

The chief answered without taking his eyes off his desk. A feather pen was held in his hand.

Another woman asked.

`I'm sure you're confused too. I just wish we had entered the devil's cave.
