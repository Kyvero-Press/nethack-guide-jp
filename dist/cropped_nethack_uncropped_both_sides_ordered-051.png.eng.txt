He was very smart and always topped the written exam. He was smart and always topped the written exam. She was knowledgeable, especially when it came to gemstones and medicine.
She was knowledgeable, especially when it came to gemstones and medicine, and few losers could match her.

Oh, that's Ruby. Don't be so rough with her.

[Z, don't you dare!
That's just a red ball of gas.

Lavishly, he said the name of the stone at the first glance and never missed once.
How do you know it's a red glass ball?
How do you know? How do you know?

Nasrullah asked repeatedly, but Lapusi only laughed and did not answer.
I don't think so.

To identify a gem, one must know the real gem as well as the forgery.
It is impossible to do so without a good knowledge of the real thing. An eye that knows the real thing will be able to detect forgeries, not the other way around.

Nasrullah somehow knew that Lavrushti came from a high class background.
Nasrullah had no idea that Lapsi was from a high class background. But Lapsi never revealed her past, nor did she seem inclined to do so.
He didn't seem to want to. Therefore, he did not ask her about her past.

We remained friends and she taught me many things about jewels and medicines. ...... I should have.
I think I'm right.

However, when I actually went into the cave to identify it, I could not understand it at all.
Even now, the yellowish color is still there. I still have a few shiny brown stones with a yellowish tinge, but I am not sure if they are just glass beads or not.
I could never tell if they were just glass balls, topaz, or ambers.
I was not sure if they were just glass balls, topaz, or ambers. If they were topaz or ambers, we would have had to take them to a specialty store, where we could get them back at a very reasonable price.
If they were topaz or ambers, we could take them to a specialty store, which would take them back for a very reasonable price. But if it was a glass ball, it would be worth nothing. It would be evil.
They are just evil.

The two are lost.

But he made up his mind quickly.

(There was no need to risk his life for a product that he did not know whether it would be sold or not.
)

She abandoned all of her treasures. She watched as the stones rolled away from her.
Nasrullah watched them roll away. Nasrullah watched the stones roll away.

Next came the medicine. Cleave could not understand it either. He smelled the same as Lavpusy.
He tried to smell the same as Lapsi, but he could not have a moment's pause. It was not enough to make me sleepy.
