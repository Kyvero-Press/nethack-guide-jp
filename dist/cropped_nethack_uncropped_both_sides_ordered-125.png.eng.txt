Cline calls out to Mike without looking at him. Mike was not paying attention to Cline or anyone else.
He was focused solely on looking at his own stomach.
I've never been in a room with so many goblins and orcs. I've never seen so many goblins and orcs in one place.
I wonder if there is some great treasure in there.

With a smirk on his face, Klein approached the long chest he had been keeping an eye on between fights.
(8) With a smirk on his face, Klein approached the long chest he had been keeping an eye on during the battle.

The chest had a sturdy-looking lock on it.
Hmmm. Hmmm... looks like it might work.

Cline mutters to herself as she examines the lock from various angles. I think we can find a way to get in.
He takes the lock pick out of the sack containing his cargo and carefully inserts it into the keyhole.
The lock pick is in the lock.

It took a lot of time, but finally Klein's dexterous fingertips loosely pushed the lock pick to the right.
Finally, Klein's dexterous fingertips rotated the lock pick to the right, and the faint sound of the lock disengaging could be heard.

A disappointed cry escapes from Klein's mouth as he peeks into the chest.

He opened the chest to see if the rice paddies were locked up, but inside was a familiar, fierce, and poisonous creature.
Inside was only a bottle of the familiar poison potion.

[I was so surprised that I could not see the poison. I can't believe I'm doing this.

Ji and Klein sat down on the floor of the cave.

The coolness of the rocky skin felt good.

Suddenly, he noticed that Mike's adultery was not visible. He looked to his left and right to see where she had gone.
Looking to his left and right, he felt someone moving in the corner of his vision. It was Kazu, the man on my right.
It was close. It was close.

It was the hobgoblin.

The body of the hobgoblin, which was lying on its back against something, was shaking slightly.
(I'm pretty sure I knocked him over. .....)

While holding his sword at the ready, Klein ponders, a figure appears from the shadow of the Hobgoblin, the only one in the cavern.
As he held his sword and pondered, the shadow of the Hobgoblin revealed his only friend in the caverns.
You did this to me, Mike?

The Hobgoblin, without even looking at Kikkiqhoktapong, continued to eat the infringing hodgepodge of food.
The "Va" is continuing to eat the invading hodgepodge of jellies, which are becoming more and more acute. The fangs of the hobgoblin's arms are now sharper and sharper, and Mike swivels his head left and right.
Mike swivels his head left and right. As the hobgoblin's corpse falls to the ground, Mike holds it by the back.

Sitting 22 Sir
Sir John Hobgoblin.

Ng.
