The wound had not healed, and the situation would have turned into a meal for Ogre. With his wounds still intact, it was obvious that he would end up as an ogre's food.
It was obvious to him that he was going to be Ogre's food.

She faced the loam.
Is it over?

Nasrullah recalled the words of Master Nealco.

As a potter, Nealco had explored many unexplored places, including the China Rock Sea.
After his retirement, he continued to be very successful in teaching the gastroenterologist.
His students include Neal Kutik, who explored Mount Eclipses, Faramond Cave, and the Grotto of Faramond.
The cave is the site of the famous Faramond Cave, which was discovered by the famous adventurer Lojarchi Rezjar.
The cave is home to a number of well-known scoundrels, including Roi Yalchi-Renzi, who revealed the whole story of the cave.

His teacher at the School for the Adversary in Nasrullah was also a conqueror. Neal Luko was a master of the skills necessary to be a blasphemer.
He taught me the skills necessary to be a blasphemer. The skills he taught me are perfectly useful in the cave.
The techniques that he taught me are perfectly useful in the cave. Without his skills, it would have been impossible to survive in the cave.
He would not be able to survive in the grotto without his skills.

On the occasion of his graduation from the training school, he gave a final instruction to all graduates: "Don't give up.
Never give up.

He looked into the eyes of his brothers and sisters.
In the cave, the one who gives up is the loser. Even if you have little strength left, you will be trapped by the monsters.
Even if you are surrounded by monsters and you are doomed to extinction, you must not give up.]

Nasrullah raised his hand. Nasrullah's friends looked at him with a stern look on their faces. Nasrullah looked at his friends with a scrutinizing look on their faces.
It was the most impolite thing to interrupt a teacher in an adult school. Some teachers would even say that they were being evil.
Some teachers would even beat up a student who had misinterpreted what they were saying. However, Master Nealko had a faint feeling that it was only Kamimine Fuchi who was being treated with such disrespect.
It was only at Kambo Fuchi.
What is it?
I have a question.
I have a question.
I think it is important not to give up, as you said. However, I really don't know how to do that.
However, there are times when there is really nothing we can do. For example, there are times when a monster surrounds you in all directions.
For example, when you are surrounded in all directions by monsters and there is no way to escape. There are times when fighting is futile.
There are times when fighting is futile. What should we do when this happens? It's over.
