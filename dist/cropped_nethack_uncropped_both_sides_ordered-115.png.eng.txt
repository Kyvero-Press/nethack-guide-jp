Yoshitsune flicked his tongue and flicked the meat off the otaku. The wild dog in front of him growled.
The wild dog was growling and chasing the meat in Yoshitune's hand with his eyes.

Yoshitune had a fierce battle with some Uruk-hai he met a few floors above, and he was forced to kill his beloved cat, Fo.
When the cat was cut down by Uruk-hai's curved sword, Yoshitsune lost all of his body parts.
It felt as if a part of him had been lost.

At that time, I wondered if I would ever again have a partner in the search for this grotto. (2) I was not so sad.
I never thought that I would experience such sadness and pain.

But now that he had been relieved of the sorrow of losing his wife, he could see how much more important it would be for (3) Josipponne.
He was reminded of how much it had meant to him.

In this bleak and dark cave, only Fomiyi was his friend. They joined forces to fight.
They would fight together, and when they found food, they would approach each other, wary of each other's presence.
They would fight with each other, and when they found food, they would approach each other, wary of each other. On one occasion, Yoshitsune distracted the shopkeeper so that the fomies could steal something from the front of the store.
The owner of the shop would be distracted by Yoshitsune, who would then steal the items on the front of the shop.

The fomiy was an irreplaceable partner.
There is no such thing as a replacement.

Josipponne said to herself whenever she thought of Fomiyi. However, even if it is not a replacement, it is not a replacement.
But it was clear that a new partner, if not a replacement, was needed. The blank space in my heart
A new partner who could make the emptiness in my heart sparkle.

Then Josine met a wild dog. The other adventurers had preceded her to the cave.
It was probably a wild dog that had been left half-dead in a cave by some other adventurer. For a wild dog, it had an unusually shiny black coat.
The black fur of the dog was rather glossy for a wild dog, but it spoke for itself.

As soon as they laid eyes on each other, Josine knew that this dog would be a good partner for her.
I can't say why, but it was the same feeling I had the first time I met a Fomiyi.
I can't say why, but it was the same feeling I had when I first met the Fomiyi.

I will add a "③" to the list of "④". I will add the following.
