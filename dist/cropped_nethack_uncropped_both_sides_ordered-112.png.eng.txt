"Oh, my God, there's nothing here."

Standing in the middle of the darkened room, Teeke's voice sounded drifting.

We went down the stairs and came to this floor, which was the third room, but it was completely empty.
There was nothing at all. There were no missing items, no treasure chests, nothing.
There is no falling equipment, no treasure chest, nothing.

There is no light in any of the rooms we have checked so far, which is why there is `nothing.
So we wasted time just trying to confirm that there was `nothing'. This is still the case in Monterey.
If only Monster had shown up, Teeke would not have been so angry. T h i c k e
If only a monster had shown up, Teeke wouldn't have been so angry.
Sometimes it's nice to have a little peace.

Teeke muttered to herself and pulled the backpack off her shoulder.
She walked around the house. She had been pacing around for a long time and had been feeling hungry for some time now.
The teche was a mess. Tique took a package called a K. Ration out of the jumble of packages.
Before she could tear it open, she found a small package of K. Ration. He had only gotten a handful before and kept it instead of eating it right then and there.
I kept it. I was excited to see what they would taste like.

Tzike thinks the food situation in the labyrinth is not so bad. However
But this is only if you don't take taste into consideration.
Oh, no!

TÃ¤itke realized that she had left the door to her room open. Once before.
Once before, she had been so absorbed in her meal that she had failed to notice the monstrosity approaching her.
Once before, he had been so absorbed in his food that he had failed to notice the monstrosity approaching him. She stood up with the package in her hand.

Teeke follows the rusty hinges with a calfskin, closes the door, and turns his head to see writing on the floor at his feet.
He closed the door behind him and saw a letter on the floor at his feet. It must have been carved with a sword or something. Ka
It's not a good idea to slash at Nepean city probes with a mud knife.
The man's name is "Kadai W. Kiriuchi". It must be the man's name. The name of the police station, "Soshikneta Winter" can also be read.
The signature "Yoshineta Fuyu" can also be read.

I wonder if it is the man's name. What kind of name is that?
