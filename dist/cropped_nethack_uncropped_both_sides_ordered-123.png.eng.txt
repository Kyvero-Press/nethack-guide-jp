How can you save money like that? How can you save so much money?

Joschine spoke lightly, but he soon realized that he could not say such a thing.
But he soon realized that this was not a good time to talk about it. There was no door in the small vault.
The narrow safe deposit box had no door. Only a heap of gold coins was standing there, groaning.
The only thing that could be seen was a heap of gold, stacked in a heap.

Joschine searched desperately for a hidden door, but each wall seemed to be nothing more than a wall.
But all the walls seemed to be nothing more than walls. Half a minute passed, and the door was still not going to appear.
I'm not joking! I'm not going to let you lock me in here! I can't be locked in here!

With a shout, Yoshine pounded on the wall as hard as she could. A pain shot up to Jositne's neck, but she didn't give it a second thought.
Yoshitune didn't care and continued to pound on the wall. If the monster is going to knock me down, I'm going to have to do something about it.
It would have been better to die locked up in a small room like this than to be knocked down by a monster.
It is far from what we want.

Then, just then, the wall opens. Then the wall opens, and a man comes out.
Hmm? I don't know who that is! Who is it?

The moment he looked up, the man raised his voice.
The moment Jositne looked up, the man's voice rose.
I'm Jositne from Samurai, . I've never heard of you. With whose permission did you enter this safe? Who allowed you to enter this safe?
Throw all your money on the floor and follow me. Throw all your money on the floor and follow me, and I will get you out of here.
I'll get it out of here.

There was no way that Joschine would have any objection to this. He had some gold that he had been carrying for some time.
He had some gold that had been in his possession for some time, but it was cheap compared to what he would have to pay for it to rot in such a place.
The gold was not worth the price of the gold.

However, the moment he was about to take the cloth out of the packet, Josine had a feeling that she was about to be taken away from him. The moment he tried to take the cloth out of the packet, however, he felt an unusual sensation.
The moment he was about to take the cloth out of the packet, however, Yoshitane felt a strange sensation welling up from deep inside his body.

There was Kiraby's head in front of Josine's eyes, and from where she could see the head of Kiraby. Then, from somewhere, a shout echoed through the air.
A shout echoed out from somewhere.
It's a bandit! They have teleportation capabilities! They have teleportation skills!

Joschine was listening to the voice of Killer Vippy as she was bathing him with her greatsword.

Apparently, the low canned food contained the meat of a monster that had teleportation capabilities.
It seems that the low canned food contained the meat of a monster that had teleportation ability. The power had transferred to Jositsune's body.
