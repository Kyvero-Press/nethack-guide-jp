Klein was running inside the demon cave.

He and Mike were covered in lots of white cream and crumbled pie crust.
Ru.

When I arrived at the door of my room and tried to open it, I found that the key was locked. That's it
When you pick up the lock and pick it up, Klein calls you.

From the door behind where Klein had entered, men wearing strange clothes started running out.
I came here. As soon as the men found Klein, they held the cream powder in their hands.
I started throwing balls at them. One pie hit Klein in the face as he swung.

``Hmm.''

② Wipe the eyelids on Klein's face.
Shaking his face violently from side to side, he threw the pie out of the way.

(Is that really what you did wrong?)

While the door was open, Klein was whispering.

- This strange escape began with an incident at a certain store.
`I'm here, Klein! I often visit Tom's roll shop.

Klein, who had been exploring the devil's cave, opens the door leading to the room as usual.
A cheerful voice greeted me.

To Klein's surprise, standing in front of him was an old man who appeared to be quite old due to his short stature.
It was. The black rope wrapped around the body suggests a face covered in keys and dead branches.
I can't help but feel the pain in my thin arms.

Behind the old man with a still smile, countless scrolls lay casually on the ground.
I was told by a samurai. When Klein entered the store, he saw a mask at his feet.
I picked up one of the eyewear and looked at it. The old man quickly picked up the scroll.
The price will be spread out for you.
`That's expensive. What kind of scroll is that?”

When Klein opened the scroll, he traced the words that made no sense and began to write them.
