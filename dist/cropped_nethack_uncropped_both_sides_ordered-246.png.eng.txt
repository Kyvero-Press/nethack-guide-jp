Jnformations

Very few people have survived the haunts of the Yenders. The Eender's
The number of people who have survived the Yenders' mVh exhibition or summit can be counted on one hand.
They are heroes, or at least they were. They became heroes, or even more than heroes.
No one can say for sure whether they were the ones who took Monda's closing m√ºtz in the Red Sea.
The first two are the same.

I will search the depths of the magical inn.
Some people searched deep into the magical world and were not able to return. Diores is one of them.
He is one of them. When he came out of Yender's cave, his chestnut-colored hair had turned gray and he was proud of his strength.
His once-strong body was as emaciated as that of an old man.

I asked many questions about Jender's cave. However, the grotto was not his body.
But the cave was not only his body, but also his spirit. Diores's answer was fragmentary and unhelpful.
Diores's answer was fragmentary and ambiguous, and at times it seemed to make no sense at all.
It seemed as if it had no meaning at all at the time. He would suddenly answer a question that had been asked two minutes earlier, or simply blurt out a monologue.
DZEDDHoTDIZ,.

I combined these waiting stories with the rumors and rumors that had been circulating until now, and I was able to find a way to get to the bottom of what was going on in Jendahl's cave.
I have succeeded in combining these stories of waiting with the rumors and other information that have been circulating and compiling them into a report for those who go to Yender's cave. However, the information contained in this article is not the only information that is available to those who go to Yender's cave,
However, I cannot judge whether this information is correct or incorrect.
I cannot judge whether the information is correct or incorrect.

I hope you will go to the Yenders' dungeon and confirm the truth of this information for yourselves.
I want you to confirm the truth of this information.

I dedicate this book to all the crazy warriors out there who love this book.
