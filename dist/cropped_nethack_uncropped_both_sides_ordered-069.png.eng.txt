It doesn't matter how crazy it seems. It doesn't matter how crazy it seems, or how reckless it is, or how desperate it is. It doesn't have to be so calm.
There is no need to be calm. Move on. Keep going. If you do, a way of life will open up for you.
Nasrullah listened in silence. Nasrullah wanted to argue, but he could not find the words.
(R-L-S-R-R-E.
[No problem. I'll know when I've done the sacrilege.
Nasrullah only nodded in agreement with the ne'er-do-well.

Nasrullah could not understand at that moment. I would be lying if I said I wasn't afraid of death.
I would be lying if I said I wasn't afraid of death. But I didn't want to die a painful death.

But her way of thinking changed when she entered the real cave. She no longer wanted to die.
She no longer wanted to die. I don't know why. She only knew that she had seen the remains of a person who had died in a dark cave without being seen.
The more I looked at the remains of those who had died without being seen, the more I became afraid. I didn't want to be like that. I wanted to live as long as I could.
I wanted to stay alive and go above ground at all costs.

An obsession grew in Nasrullah's heart.
Is it worth it?

Nasrullah whispered and inspected the wall. Nasrullah grinds the lehenga and digs at his swimsuit. R
Nasrullah mumbles and examines the wall.

It was only a few moments later that she found the pull of the hidden door.

If a staircase could not be found in the Yerender's cave, or if a vendor's store could not be found, then the woman would have to go to the store to find the right one.
If you can't find a staircase in Yerender's Grotto, it's likely that you missed a hidden door or a hidden passageway.

This is when e-command is used. In places where a door or passage is likely to be hidden, the (s) key is used.
In many cases, it is difficult to see the door or passageway, so it is best to use the e-command as many times as you wish.
Let's try the e-command as many times as we can. If you input "n I0s", you will get a zero-cause connection.
You can continue searching.

Also, the elves will automatically check walls and paths without the need to enter an e-command.
They can also check walls and corridors automatically without having to input an e-command. They have the psychic ability to detect the slightest irregularity in walls and corridors.
However, they are not infallible, so do not be overconfident. I thought it was funny.
Let's try using a command that I thought was interesting. Only elves have the ability to search from birth.
Only the elves have the ability to search, but archaeologists, thieves, and (why not?) turists have the ability to search by experience.
But the archaeologist, the thief, and (somehow) the tourist all have the same ability through experience.
