Wipe face with a wipe.

Cline was running in a cave.

His and Mike's bodies were covered in white creams and crusted pies.
He and Mike were covered in white creams and crusted pie skins.

They reached the door of the room, and when they tried to open it, it was locked. Quickly, the lock bips open and the door is locked.
Quickly, he took out the lock bipick and found that the cabin was locked.

A man wearing strange clothes came running out of the door behind which Klein had entered.
A man in a strange outfit came running out of the door behind Klein. As soon as they saw Klein, they threw a cream pie into his hand.
They started throwing the cream pies in their hands. One of the pies hit Klein in the face as he turned around.
One of the pies hit the face of the swinging client.
Mwah!

(8) The player wipes his hands on the slippery ream that Cline has just put on his face.
(2) Neku shakes his face violently to the left and to the right to hit the pai.

(Was that the best he could do?)

While opening the door, Klein blurts out, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

This strange escape began with an incident in a store.
Come here, Klein! You are welcome at the Tom's roll-up store.

Cline, who had been searching the cave, opened the door to her room as usual.
When he opened the door to his room as usual, he was greeted by a cheerful voice.

Standing in front of the startled Klein was a short, elderly man.
He was a short, elderly man. The black rope covering his body reminded me of a face covered with keys and a dead branch.
The skinny arms were visible through the black ropes that covered his body.

Behind the old man's still, smiling face, a myriad of scrolls lay haphazardly on the ground.
Behind the old man's still, smiling face, numerous rolls were randomly placed on the ground. Cline entered the store with trepidation, and saw the eye rolls at his feet.
He picked up one of the eyeglasses that lay on the floor at his feet. The old man immediately offered to sell him the price of the scroll he had picked up.
The old man immediately offered me the price of the scroll in his hand.
What is the price of the roll? What exactly is this scroll? What kind of roll is it?

Cline unrolls the roll and begins to whisper, slurring an unintelligible word.
