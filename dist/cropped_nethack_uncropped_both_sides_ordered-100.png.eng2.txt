Tyke bent down and gently picked up the ring.

``Yes!''

Startled by the shopkeeper's voice, Tike almost drops the ring.

0 is 466, 7 052 ③⑧

The shopkeeper, who was polishing his shields at the end of the shop, paused and took a look at the tea from behind his round-rimmed glasses.
I was staring at him. The look on the shopkeeper's face was, "Oh, are you going to buy it?"
he asked silently.

Tyke smiled shyly. Fascinated by the beauty of the ring, I reached out my hand.
I feel ashamed of myself. Do you know what kind of effect it has?
I don't know what to do.

That's what I'm saying. You can use your own recipes to freeze things you didn't expect 26]
`Kia Ne. I'm not interested in that kind of thing. The important thing is how long it is.

Tike hurriedly asked the shopkeeper a question as he tried to get back to work.
``How can you put a price on it when you don't know anything about it?''
``Well, that's just a business person's intuition. That ring is also what was dug out.
I'm sure there is no mistake. I would love to put up a signboard for this store.”

Tyke sighed. At this store, you can find unique and unknown items at great prices.
It's for sale. It seems like the only thing you can rely on when it comes to what you need is your own eyes.

After putting the ring back in its place, Tieke walks around the store and buys food and healing.
Effects on magic potions, magic spells, etc.
I collected only the items that I knew. However, only regarding the spelling book.
On the contrary, I only collected things that I was seeing for the first time.
``This one is ②⑥0, that one is ④00. The food ratio there is ③ and ②⑤0.”

As the shop owner read it out loud, Tieke laid out the gold chips.
