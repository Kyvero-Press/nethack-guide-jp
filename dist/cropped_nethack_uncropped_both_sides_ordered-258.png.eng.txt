It is almost impossible.

This question was finally answered by Diores.
Don't you know that many of the monsters in the cave can be eaten? And there is a food store.
There are food stores and food drops here and there. We can get enough nutrients.
We can get enough nutrients, and we can even go on the rare occasion that we are hungry. Well, I've been hungry.
Well, I'm hungry a lot, but it's not that painful. However, I don't know how I feel about the taste.
I don't know if you've ever eaten Norijak meat.
I've never eaten Norwegian meat. You may not even want to eat it, but it's necessary.
The food situation in the caves of the Yenders is not that bad, as long as you don't overdo it on the taste.
The food situation in Yeddah's cave did not seem so bad. However, I did not think I would eat the meat of Yakitori or Migi-kimi.
I wouldn't want to eat the meat from the mouths of the birds.

Moreover, Diores had given him some valuable information about the taste and smallness of monster meat.

[The monster's meat has special powers that can be acquired by eating the meat of a monster with special powers.
The woman was too lazy to go to the lake. After eating an ant that has the ability to withstand fire, the fire will feel hot.
The fire was hot and the ants were weak. There are many ants that can withstand fire (8) But not a few of them contain poison.
Some of them were so poisonous that we could not understand what they were as soon as we ate them.
Once you eat them, you will never forget them, but it would be the worst thing to be attacked by another monster immediately after eating them.
Being attacked by another monster right after eating such an item was the worst thing that could have happened....

I have heard this story a few times. Replacorns, or nymphs, for that matter.
It is said that a person who eats the flesh of a monster with transdimensional power, such as a Replacon or a Nymph, gains that transdimensional power.
It is a kind of story in which a person who eats the flesh of a monster with transdimensional power, such as a nymph, obtains that transdimensional power. However, this story is about a man who can control his power, and who is able to enter the walls of the world.
But these stories often end with `I get inside the wall where I can't control the power and end up dying.
It was very difficult to determine whether it was just a legend or the truth.
Tsubame S.

According to his story, obtaining this kind of ability was not always a certainty.
It seems that it is not always a certainty, but more or less a matter of luck. The more powerful the monster is, the more likely it is that it will be able to achieve its potential.
The more powerful the monster was, the easier it seemed to gain power.

Later, Diores' talk turned to the characteristics of many of the monsters. The characteristics of the monsters were discussed.
The details of the characteristics of these monsters are described in detail in my book "The Book of Enchanted Cave Exploration: The Biology of Monsters.
B, please refer to them in detail. I have also referred to many of the honors of the "Mimamori" in my book.
