Nasrullah raises his sword.

(0) (5) (5) (5) Daah!

The great sword falls through the air with a roar.

Elf fists the sword above her head to block the waiting woman's slash. But the movement is too late.
But it is too late. Nasrullah's flash slips past Elf's defenses and lands a blow on her left shoulder.
WZ AT,

Blue blood drenches Nasrullah's cheek and stirrup.

Elf swung his sword in counterattack, but he had no strength. But he has no more strength. Nasrullah's sword
He could have taken it in a minute with Nasrullah's sword. If he had been a little further ahead, he would have been able to stop him,
If he had stopped him a little earlier, he would have been blown away by the wall of the cave.

Nasrullah sheathed Elf's sword and continued his assault. He gave a hard thrust and then struck with a flanker's cleave.
Nasrullah then flicked his sword to the side.

The elf held up his sword. The dark green sword glinted faintly.
I am Nevaeh, a warrior of Dark Elves and head of the Hive Perion Cavalry.
I am Nevaeh. How can I surrender to a mere mortal?

Nevaeh Vi, his upper body stained with blue blood, attacked. He swung his sword high in the air.
The sword was thrown back and aimed at the top of Nasrullah's head. It was a precise blow. But Nasrullah was not to be fooled.
