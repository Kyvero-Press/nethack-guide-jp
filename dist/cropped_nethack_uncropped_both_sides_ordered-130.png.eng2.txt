Monster’s Ab…ty

The vibration that shakes the earth makes the cave tremble.

A red dragon wrapped in dark crimson scales walks through the cave of Yendar.
It's ⑧ e Kei

Strangely enough, there was a figure of Mike behind the dragon. About the size of a small leopard
⑧ The driver who reported the progress was dragging the dragon in the middle of the night (⑧ Walking with good health ⑤).

A voice leaks from the mouth of a dragon with sharp fangs.

The dragon's voice was strangely hoarse, perhaps because its vocal organs were dying, but...
was definitely Klein's voice.

``I had heard that there was a ring that could transform into a monster...but that was this guy.''
Naa.”

With that said, Kutaline turned her eyes to the gold and silver rings she wore on the tips of her sharp nails on both of her arms.
I'll take you there.

In the darkness, two rings with mysterious magic sparkle.

7. Oh!

Suddenly, the microphone let out the cry that is used to intimidate an enemy.

When Klein craned his long neck to look ahead, he saw a monster.
It's a monster.

On top of the gigantic body of the humanoid monster, grew the head of an ugly cow. In order
Beneath its broken horns, the monster's crimson eyes were staring at Klein.
(Cuckoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much)

Klein raises his voice inside his chest.

Minotaur rushed toward Klein. East of the strong and thick meat
But it was crawling with Minotaur's red, tin-colored skin.

A: I was also a Bilhi and my partner was: Now (way)

When Klein opened his mouth, his fangs were clenched together, a swollen wound appeared from Klein's stoma.
A crimson flame burst forth.

For a moment, the area was melted by intense light.
