It was the first time that Tiecke had ever known such a pleasant sensation.

A rapturous feast from the depths of her body assaulted her consciousness, and she continued to scream incomprehensible words into the air, lost in her own mind.
The intense joy that welled up from deep within her body assaulted her consciousness, making her yell out incomprehensible words without a care in the world.

Suddenly, Tätike looked for the gown and threw it away.

She reaches for a pile of clothes in the corner and stops to look at a spell book that has fallen next to it.
His line of sight stops at the spell book that has fallen beside it.

Ek.

While she was trying to memorize the spell book, Aitsu came to her.

It was a humanoid monster called an incubus.

While she was concentrating her spirit to learn a new spell, Teeke was attacked by an Inkyubus that approached her from behind.
She did not notice the incubus approaching from behind her. The door to the room was not closed at all.
The door to the room was not closed at all, because most of the people in the room were not in the room until the door was closed.
Most mongers or miki-something madmen will know the first blow is taken and will be able to counterattack.
They will be able to counterattack.

However, Reynkjubas did not attack Tjike, but instead finished him off.

Teiche does as he is told, throws away his weapons, grips his stirrups, and .......

Biting his lip, he rose to his feet.

Silently, he puts on his shirts and picks up his padded mail from the floor.
Inexplicably, she felt as if she were becoming lighter. I had a bowl of fortified cookies that I had eaten a long time ago.
On a piece of paper that had been in a fondue cookie I had eaten a long time ago, I read that the inky baths kill those who like them, and that the ones who like them better are the ones who get the most out of them.
I wonder if it is true.
Teeke wondered, while wearing the stirrups, if this was true.

He strapped his shield to his left arm and lowered his mace to his waist. He wanted to find the spring and get to the bottom of his body.
B, moreover, (8) there was something I needed to be bald about.

After locking the two doors of the house with a wardrobe, Teeke sat down on the floor.
After locking the two doors of the house with the wand, Täche sat down on the floor. She places the spellbook she had just finished reading on her lap.

On the cover of the spellbook, it says in gold letters

"finger of death".

The incubus must still be somewhere on this floor.

We must find him and get back at him with this incantation.
