``It's so heavy!''

I was wondering what would happen if I abandoned this J-Tedent and ran away.
I stopped and thought. Kitto Chrom gets angry and lends his strength to ② Degree and Tyke.
I don't think I can do it.
② Approximately ② uce sakin, shii, go......⑥ times?”

Tike thought about how much help he had received from Chrom up until now.
I did it. When I was still at the edge of the labyrinth, I ran out of food and was about to starve to death. Ko
Catrice's petrifying poison spreads throughout his body, and just before he loses consciousness, he calls out to Chrom.
When. When you're surrounded by minnows, you'll recover your physical strength with the power of chromium.
There have been times when I have had trouble doing so. Other than that, it was also used to remove a cursed ring.
There are so many ripples that it is like God.
`Well, I don't have to deal with this problem. ...But it's heavy!"

Tyke regained his composure and started moving his legs again.

dedicate, pray
