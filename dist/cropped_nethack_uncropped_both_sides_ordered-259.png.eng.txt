The following is a summary of the results of the study.

DeGeolens admitted that he had even defeated the Piedragonmi. His discourse was not the only one.
There was nothing in the story that was true, but it is probably true. It could be a juvenile dragon.
It may have been a juvenile dragon.

The Last Hour - His Death

It has been a long time since I first visited Wait's house.

That day, I had almost finished the book and went to Deion Leslie to have it checked.
I had almost finished the book and went to Deion Leslie to check it out. But what I found at his house was the remains of a waiting list.

He had some treasures - probably from the Ejender's Grotto - that he had acquired.
He was lying dead in his bed, having sorted out his treasures. And beside him was a suicide note addressed to me.

According to the will, Diores was aware that he had a mental disorder.
He was also aware of his own mortality. He also knew that he had very little life left in him, which is why his mind was so clear.
He knew that his life was very short, so he tried to give me as much information as he could while his mind was still clear.
I was very grateful to him for his kindness.

I have been able to share with him as much information as I can by writing about my experiences in the cave.
I hope that by writing about the various things I have experienced in the grotto, there will be fewer people like him who fall into madness.
I hope that by writing this report, there will be fewer people like him who fall into madness.

Therefore, this book, which was supposed to be my research and circulated among a small group of people, was not published.
The book became publicly available.

Again, in the past, Diores was a strong warrior. He had become such a mighty man.
There is such madness in the cave that it would take a man of this stature to become such a madman. And he could not fight this madness.
Those who cannot fight this madness, no matter the treasure they hope to find, will not be able to stand in the grotto of the Yender.
Those who cannot fight this madness will not stand in the grottoes of the Yenders, even if they have the treasure in their sights.

It is a trial that may cost more than their lives, and they will have to pay a price for it.
We would be happy if you could understand the wishes of Diores.
