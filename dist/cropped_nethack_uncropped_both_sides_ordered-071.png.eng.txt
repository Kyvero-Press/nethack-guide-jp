It's so heavy! `He's so heavy!

Teeke stopped and thought about what would happen if he threw away the jitendent and ran away.
What would happen if I left this jitendent and ran away? Krom was furious and would never help her again.
He would not be able to help her again.
He would not be able to help Teeke again. (6) times? (6) times?

T ik e wondered how much K r o m had helped him in the past.
He remembered how much Krom had helped him in the past. When she was still at the bottom of the labyrinth, when she ran out of food and nearly starved to death. I was still at the bottom of the maze, starving to death because we had run out of food.
When the petrified poison of Cockatrice had poisoned his body, and he had called out to Krom just before he lost consciousness.
When he called out to Kromm just before he was rendered unconscious by the petroleum poison from Cockatrice. When he was surrounded by minophthaurs and was restored to health by Krom's power.
On another occasion, he was restored to his physical strength by the power of Krom. Other times, he was asked to remove a cursed ring, or to do some other trivial thing.
Other times, it was to remove a cursed ring, or for some other random reason.
We must do at least this much. ...... But it's heavy! It's heavy!

Teeke regained his composure and started to move his legs again.
