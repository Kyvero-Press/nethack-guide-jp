The length was huge. It was the largest jackal she had ever fought.
0 Aa ! ]

Nasrullah cheered.
`It's so bubby!

Nasrullah leapt at him faster than Jhakkar could attack him.
He swung his sword with all his strength and tried to duck, but was turned to the right. He was so hungry that he could not exert himself.
He was hungry, and his body was not strong enough. In any other situation, his neck and torso would have been cut in two without a doubt.

Jhakkar was on him faster than Nasrullah could draw his sword. Kajkar's sword was in the air, but he had to fight his way out of it.
The sword, which he had barely managed to claw out, blocked his fangs in front of him. Fangs and sword clashed, and Jhakkar's foul-smelling breath was heard on the ground as he swiped at the eggplant.
Jacquel's foul-smelling breath poked Nasrullah in the nose.

Nasrullah backed away and swung his sword, but only scratched his ear.
B

Nasrullah continues to attack, but not as fast as he would like. On the contrary, Jhakal's claws and fangs were chasing him.
The claws and fangs of Jhakkar were chasing him down. Jerkal is not the kind of opponent that I would normally take the time to deal with, but now he is just too slow.
But now it was too late. I couldn't put strength into my arm to wield the sword, and it was difficult to hit the target itself.
I was not able to do it.
(If I don't do this, I will be eaten before I can eat meat.)

(3) He had to make a last-ditch counterattack before he ran out of energy, so he decided to go for the slingshot.
He decides to stick out the tip and bend over.
Come on!]

Nasrullah's spirit is up, and at the same time, Jhakkar leaps forward. Nasrullah is not going to let him get away.
Nasrullah has no intention of escaping. Nasrullah is not about to let Nasrullah get away. He catches Jhakkar's fangs from above and stops his opponent.
Nasrullah was not about to let Nasrullah get away. JACKAL continues to push, but Nasrullah does not back down. JACKAL retreated backward.
(2) Nasrullah cannot pull back.

The passion she puts into her flesh is unbelievable. She exerts as much physical strength as she can,
She pushes the jackal that is far stronger than she is.

Jacquel, feeling disadvantaged, should keep his distance from Nasrullah, who will follow him.
(8) "Ah!

Nasrullah took advantage of the moment and unsheathed his sword. Nasrullah was just about to retreat.
Nasrullah could not even dodge the jakkar because he had just retreated. A killing blow struck him in the skull.
The brain was torn apart. The brain entanglements flew off and the eyeballs fell out.
