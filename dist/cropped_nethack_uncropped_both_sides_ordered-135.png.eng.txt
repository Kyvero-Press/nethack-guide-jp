Behind Klein and Mike, the strangely dressed men are still chasing after them.
The chasing party is still on the move. One after another, the pursued Clain opened the door, and suddenly a small carving appeared.
A small sculpture shattered in front of him.

I wonder if he's going to pay us? And do you want some more cream pie?
I wonder.

It was the owner of the roll shop with the black robes. The old man's friendly smile faded from his face.
The smile on the old man's face was gone, and his voice was dry and cold.

It seemed that the old man had returned to the roller shop while he was trying to escape.
Behind the old man, men with creampies and gumballs were waiting for Klein's answer.
He was waiting for Klein's answer.

I know, I know.

With a sigh, Klein pays the old man for the roll.

When Klein gives the money, the men disappear instantly, leaving the old man behind.
Glimmering

I am afraid and pale.

In front of the whispering Klein, the owner of the scroll shop begins to calculate the amount of money.
Mike, who was standing next to Klein, was licking the clean silk on his neck to make it look delicious.
He was a good man, and he was a good man.

Use the #w command to wipe your face.

Normally, using a #w command only removes dirt from the face, but with cream pies, etc., you can see the eyes.
However, if you are blinded by a creampie or other accident, you can use the commands to help you out of a state of blindness.
The KiMeDanRiHo is a fine piece of equipment that can be used to help you sail away from a blind state.

The #w command may not be used often, but in a cave, it can be used to help you escape from blindness.
I don't know how crazy things can get in the cave, so I'm not going to go into it with a plan.
