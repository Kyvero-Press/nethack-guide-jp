Albena, who had won a large sum of money through a drinking game with a big, hulking man, was in a good mood when she began her story.
He was in a good mood and began to talk.
It's hard to continue searching in this cave, but I think it's a curse that's been placed on me.
It's a curse that's been keeping us here for a long time. The fastest way to break this one is to read the scrolls of the curse.
But there are other ways.
"Hes, m-l-i-e-i-d-i-e.

I looked at the drunken and sober pariah about to be led out of the bar all by himself.
Klein asked, looking sideways at the drunken Vaparian who was about to be led out of the tavern alone.

If you are lucky, the spell will be broken.

After saying this, Albena pulled down her dress and saw three warts on her right shoulder and across the valley of her white breast.
Three identical claw marks crept from her right shoulder to the valley of her white breast.

Cline screams in her heart and tries to rush away, but her arms and legs are motionless. But his arms and legs were not moving.
But his arms and legs wouldn't move. He was so mesmerized by the beauty of the nymphs that he couldn't move his body to do anything about it. Even the misanthropic Mike was unable to move his arms and legs.
Even Mike, a misanthrope, was rubbing his cheek against Nymph's foot.

After a few moments, when Klein comes to his senses, Nymph is gone.
