The nethacks in the accompanying diskettes in this book have been modified in various ways, so it is not possible to play them with floppy disks.
It is possible, but nearly impossible in practice, to play on the floppy disk. It is not impossible, but it is close to impractical.
If you want to play on the Internet, you will need to have a Hack or EMS.
Let's go over how to prepare to play the hack.

Requirements

Req 臺

Items required to play the nethack stored in the attached disk.
There are several items that are required.

First, let's list what is absolutely necessary.

First, PC-⑨⑧0① VF or later with main memory of ⑥④0 KB or more is absolutely necessary.
This is absolutely necessary. In other words, a PC with a CPU of V30 or higher (9), 8), 0①, 0①, 0①, and 1) is absolutely necessary.
In other words, PC-89⑧0① series with V30 or higher CPU and PC-②⑧⑥/③⑧⑥/④⑧⑥ series are sufficient. The following two series are available.
The models released within the past two years should be sufficient.

And, MS-DOS version (3) or later is required. The MS-DOS version (3) or later is required.

Next, we will list what we would like to have if possible. First, a hard disk.
The accompanying disk for this document includes background music and CG images for the Nethack.
The accompanying disk of this book also contains background music and image CG for the Nethack, so in order to retain them, a floppy disk would require two discs.
The first set contains the BGM and image CGs for the movie, and the second set contains the BGM and image CGs for the movie.

In addition, an additional memory that can be used as an EMS and a corresponding EMS driver would be a nice addition to the system.
If there is an EMS driver for the EMS and an additional memory that can be used as an EMS, it would be a good choice. The nethack is not necessarily stuck without it, but it does slow it down.
The nethack would be slow and almost unplayable in practice.

In the meantime, you will want to be sure to have an English-Japanese dictionary and a large number of other useful documents available.
