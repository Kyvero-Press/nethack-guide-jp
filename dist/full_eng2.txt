I thought about it. In other words, it was from the mother that the mother felt so strongly.

(If a monster comes, there won't be a single one.)

I tried to smile bitterly, but I couldn't even move my lips.

I felt bad. Ever since I got a hangover from drinking too much when I was in training school.
It was a feeling. That time was the first time I drank something called alcohol, so I was wondering where my limits were.
I couldn't really tell. I'm so drunk with lightning that Lifo and Labcy stop me.
That didn't work either, so I opened the second bottle of wine. The next day I couldn't move and lay on my bed.

However, that was it. The ruler can no longer move his fingers.

Nasrullah knows how the thieves outside the training center are called.
Ru. I was accompanied by a thief who said he was proud of his thief career.
There were very few students. One of the few exceptions was Nasrullah.

For some reason, Nasrulla and Rifo were interested. The technique I learned from him was mathematics.
I don't know. I learned how to open a box, how to remove a piece of greenery, and how to use my hands almost entirely from his teachings.

Let's go. It was a stirrup that I had never seen before.
However, she knew. They say it's a dragon's stirrup. Other's
It is said that a hoe is stronger and has more defensive power than a stirrup.

I have never seen one before. When my aunt's brother died, I was at the forefront of organizing the funeral.
I arranged it. She was even referred to as the ``Iron Lady'' behind her back.

Nasrullah couldn't believe the sight of her aunt crying like a child.
Ta . I didn't know what to do, I just remained calm. Did my uncle sleep with my aunt?
If you hadn't trained me, I don't know if I would have stayed up until dawn.
`If your daughter is going on an adventure, no one can stay calm. Going to my wife
It is different from most people. It's more likely that we'll never meet again.''

Nasrullah listened to her uncle's words in silence.

``Even so, you still want to go.''
The ruler was easy to use.

COMMANDS To walk through the devil's cave -

If you kick a monster, you will receive damage. Especially the samurai and priest's kicks.
The force is so strong that it is possible to defeat monsters on shallow levels with a single blow.

Normal doors can be opened using the o command, but opening a locked door is not possible.
To do this, you can use a duplicate key or credit card, or you can just kick it open.
There is no way. However, the door that I had just kicked in could not be closed again.
If you plan to use that door from now on, such as when you need a parlor for some reason.
It would be wiser to just stop. Also, kicking the soil will only hurt your feet, but that's fine.
If this was a hidden door, you could kick it down just like you could a visible door.
Ru.

When you kick an item, it usually moves in the direction it was kicked.
Ru. However, if you kick the potion, it may break due to the impact, so I decided not to do so.
That would be better. The distance an item must be moved depends on its weight and strength.
(Items that are too heavy will not move). The only thing you have to do is forget it.
This means that you can break the key by kicking the treasure chest. Tadasito
If the wrap is set up, it is important to make sure it is working properly.

I wanted to collect all of them in one place because I was a little disappointed.

There are about 8 in total. How many treasure chests were found in one room?
This was my first experience with tea. There is a castle on the upper floor, with an arsenal of weapons and treasures.
I went to look at the treasure chest, but there it was, just lined up in the room with treasure chests.

Tike was chewing while standing in front of a pile of treasure chests. From my experience, what is inside the treasure chest?
The reason I bought it was because I knew it was a good item.

Tike inserts an excalibur between the lids and uses his entire body weight to pry open the reservoir.

I'm sure there is no mistake. I would love to put up a signboard for this store.”

Tyke sighed. At this store, you can find unique and unknown items at great prices.

Therefore, an undead person who knows the location is not actually looking at it with his eyes.
The effect is not as good as that. Similarly, when you are on the safe side, you should also turn.

The key is whether or not the turn will be successful and the undead will be destroyed.
The rate of eye contact with Mac's Peri-Le and R-K's Gungyore is also low.
Against undead, the turn is almost guaranteed to succeed. More than that
The card has to withstand (resist) turns, and the wider the difference in level, the better the performance.

I knew that I was left with a simple choice. That's all this time
Regardless of the situation, I had to make this choice.
But since there are no other options left, there is nothing we can do about it.
``Are you ready?''

Everyone in the room let out a sigh, and Yoshine stumbled to her feet.
The sumac, which was curled up in a circle on the other side of the tree, also noticed its presence and said, ``Here we go!''
I yawned and stood up.

It was important to obtain the famous sword and stirrup, but even more important was to draw it alive.
Even Yossine knew what was going on and what was going on. Just put a step on it.
I felt sorry for myself for wasting so much of my time.

After that, the Yoshine that was caught in the teleport trap landed in front of this long tree.

In a fierce battle with several Uruk-hai that Yoshitsune met a few floors above, he lost his beloved cat's foo.
When Shin'yo was cut in half by Uruk-hai's curved sword,
It felt like a part of his body was missing.

At that time, I thought it would be a good idea to take a partner with me to explore this magical cave. ②
I never thought that I would experience such sorrow and pain as I did.

However, now that I have been relieved of the pain of losing my friend, I feel his presence in my home.
I was reminded of something very important.

The thought of the poisoned arrows used by the orcs flashed in Yoshitune's mind, but it was already dark.
The silhouette of a monster rose out of the sky. Half-man, half-horse...
``Kentaurus!'' What about Yender's Cave?''

Centaurs are a species that originally lived in grasslands and mountains. Yender's cave is wide

A sturdy-looking lock is attached to the long chest.
`Hmph. Looks like something's going to happen.''

While examining the lock from various angles, Klein muttered to himself. Put your luggage in
Remove the lock pick from the provided sack and carefully insert it into the keyhole.

It took a while, but finally Klein's deft fingertips clicked the lock.
As I turned the lock all the way to the right, I heard the faint sound of the lock coming off.

As Klein peered into the contents of the chest, a sound of disappointment came out of his mouth.

After making sure that the rice field was well-filled, I opened the chest, but there was something inside.
There were only ① books of the familiar highly poisonous potion lying around.

[Z2Vy !l Castle ambition saza kousuke? Just help me.”

Klein sat down on the floor of the cave as he stuffed the potion into the sack.

The coolness of the rock surface is soothing.

Suddenly, Klein realized that he couldn't see Mike having sex. Where did you go?
As I looked both left and right, I felt someone move in the corner of my vision. right hand sum

The person who moved was Maho Budzugo Pudding.

The hob goblin's body was swaying slightly as it rested its back on something.
(I'm sure I beat him, but...)

As Klein thought while holding his sword, a demon appeared from the shadow of the hob goblin.
In the cave, my only friend appeared.
``Is this your job, Mike?''

Even if you don't look at it, you can't eat it.
Continuing. The hobgoblin's sharp fangs were pressed into its arms, and Mike was at its neck.
I moved it from side to side. As the hobgoblin's corpse fell to the ground, I took care of its back.

The thing that had been on display revealed itself.

It was an elaborate throne.

The throne has many intricate details, and its graceful curves are the result of a master craftsman's work.
It was an experience that I had never experienced before.

Thinking it might be a new trap, Klein goes to the throne to find out if he's been set.

I looked into it carefully.

``Is it nothing? I don't know what to do.''

As he explored the Demon Palace, Klein spoke more and more to himself.

He sat down firmly on the throne.

And I was overwhelmed by their animal-like cries.

`Oh no, no, no. This time, even the undead trolls will come.”
Klein stood up and pulled out his sword, which was still wet with blood.

``Please listen to the microphone.''

With a loud cry, Klein started running towards the group of monsters.
On the other hand, Mike was still enjoying his meal as casually as ever.

If you want to sit on the throne while playing NetBackup, use the #s command.

Just then, Klein stands up in a panic and corrects himself.

Mike let out a heartbreaking cry as his proud long tail was stepped on by the taxi.

Mike makes a grudge-like cry when he hears an angry cry.

``I'm proud of you.'' ② I told you that ① I asked for it.

As I turned away from Klein, who had a sore foot, the microphone moved to the corner of the room.
Apparently, I had made the wise decision that it would be better for me to stay away from this annoying master for now.

When the microphone near the door of the room turned around, Klein was still bored.
He was jumping around in his jumping boots. Mike seems to be playing something nearby.
I looked around to see if there was anything I could find, but all I could find was a rotting carcass of a jackal.
There was nothing I could find that interested me.

At that moment, as Mike looked around, he felt something smell like an animal in his nose.

As Mike was about to turn around, a gigantic foot swung down in front of him.

` Ku ④ Yes. At a time like this, I'm excited... Wait, if I could use this thing right now...''

Klein was just there when he heard the sound of footsteps approaching, reminiscent of the echoing sound of an ogre.
I put all my strength into my legs and kicked the ground. Klein's body suspended in the air and flew through a pit.
He crossed over and landed right in front of the microphone. Then, a loud sound echoed through the demon cave.

Strangely enough, there was a figure of Mike behind the dragon. About the size of a small leopard

A voice leaks from the mouth of a dragon with sharp fangs.

The dragon's voice was strangely hoarse, perhaps because its vocal organs were dying, but...
was definitely Klein's voice.

``I had heard that there was a ring that could transform into a monster...but that was this guy.''

With that said, Kutaline turned her eyes to the gold and silver rings she wore on the tips of her sharp nails on both of her arms.
I'll take you there.

In the darkness, two rings with mysterious magic sparkle.

7. Oh!

Suddenly, the microphone let out the cry that is used to intimidate an enemy.

When Klein craned his long neck to look ahead, he saw a monster.
It's a monster.

On top of the gigantic body of the humanoid monster, grew the head of an ugly cow. In order
Beneath its broken horns, the monster's crimson eyes were staring at Klein.

Klein raises his voice inside his chest.

Suddenly, Minotaur looked down and spotted Klein. a moment of silence
After that, a growl was heard and fangs were exposed from the burnt and dripping mouth.

Sun, Naik…let’s run away!”

With that scream, Klein took Mike with him and ran away.

If you are interested in exploring the devil's cave as a humanoid character, you can live in the devil's cave.
It might be fun to play as a monster.

The easiest way is to wear a ring of change and a ring of change operation on both hands.
It won't have any immediate effects, but it will give you a lot of energy in the long run.

When you pick up the lock and pick it up, Klein calls you.

From the door behind where Klein had entered, men wearing strange clothes started running out.

I started throwing balls at them. One pie hit Klein in the face as he swung.

Shaking his face violently from side to side, he threw the pie out of the way.

While the door was open, Klein was whispering.

`I'm here, Klein! I often visit Tom's roll shop.

Klein, who had been exploring the devil's cave, opens the door leading to the room as usual.
A cheerful voice greeted me.

To Klein's surprise, standing in front of him was an old man who appeared to be quite old due to his short stature.
It was. The black rope wrapped around the body suggests a face covered in keys and dead branches.
I can't help but feel the pain in my thin arms.

Behind the old man with a still smile, countless scrolls lay casually on the ground.
I was told by a samurai. When Klein entered the store, he saw a mask at his feet.
I picked up one of the eyewear and looked at it. The old man quickly picked up the scroll.
The price will be spread out for you.
`That's expensive. What kind of scroll is that?”

When Klein opened the scroll, he traced the words that made no sense and began to write them.

He was the owner of a roll shop and wore a black robe. A friendly smile on the old man's face.
The voice disappeared, and what escaped from his mouth was a dry, cold voice.

Apparently, while running away, he ended up back at the roll shop.
Behind the old man, men with cream pies and rubber hoses were crying.
I was waiting for your response.

With a sigh, Klein paid the old man for the scroll.

When Klein offered the money, the men disappeared in an instant, leaving the old man behind.

Gross and the woman exchanged words for a while, but then a new customer arrived.
And Gross went to pick up the order, which he was reluctant to do. The woman held a heavy sake pot in her right hand.
Then he started pouring himself a second glass of sake.

Klein was fascinated by the woman's appearance, and they were having a heated conversation at a table near the entrance of the store.
I heard a noise. Mulberry wondered what was going on and turned around when a wooden chair flew into the line of sight of the taxi line.
I was depressed. The chair was flying towards the woman next to me. Klein instantly
He stretched out his left arm and grabbed a chair in the air.

Its strength is no more than a meager claw, but it is a great source of strength for those with a strong stomach who have the necessary equipment.
There should be no difference.

In addition, carnivorous baboons (carnivorous apes) were originally omnivorous.
Because it has continued to eat meat, its ferocity has increased, and its body size is almost twice that of a normal baboon.
We specifically classify and call things that are becoming more common. Especially those who live in the demon cave of Yender.
It appears to be very fond of human flesh, so protectors should be careful. just
However, these animals rarely act without makeup, and they often wander around like lone wolves.
Because of their large numbers, they are thought to be easier to defeat than normal baboons in an overall sense.

The meat of baboons is said to be as delicious as any other monster in Yander's cave.

When they spot an unruly intruder, they use their tiny fangs to protect their territory.
It jumps with a sword and hits you. However, it doesn't have a lot of strength, so it has a large capacity.
You should be able to repel it easily. However, bats' behavior is inconsistent.
And I just want that part to be like a waterfall. I was afraid that I was coming closer, and I was afraid that I was far away.
If you think about it, it will come closer, making it very difficult to aim.

Also, the vampire bat (vyampire bat) is basically the same thing as the giant bat.

In Yender's cave there is a plain centaur that lives in the meadows.
The forest centaur, which lives in the forest, lives in the mountains.
The existence of mountain centaur has been reported.

Centaurs are supposed to be nature-loving creatures, but why not?
It is not entirely clear how they came to live in caves.

Their main weapons are bows and arrows, but in close combat they use powerful kicks from their horse's legs.

Her chestnut-colored hair, which was eyed with envy by many girls, was curled.
It turned out to be white hair.

Her eyes lost their shine and were colored with fear. The words that spill out from the sky have no meaning.
I didn't think so.

There is no way for me, except God, to know what kind of fear attacked him.

However, there was a problem with the game of Go.

The spirit of Diores was shattered and scattered in the demon cave of Yesterday. Since then, this hut
He has been holed up in a tree, cut off contact with humans, and lived in darkness. Mare town

Then I stood in front of the door of his house.

When I opened the door, the door seemed like it would fall with just one knock, so I was rude.
Due to the law, I didn't bother knocking, but there was a strange odor that was painful to the eye.

I felt a slight sense of despair as I struggled to escape into the darkness while shouting questions.
I am a very talented person who is able to plan and interact with other people.
I don't even know what it is.

Thus, my first meeting with Diores ended in half-despair. he said i left
However, he continued to throw things at him, as if he hated light itself, and his home.
The surrounding area was scattered.

Well, I brought some souvenirs with me.

Diores who were afraid of me at first began to open up to me,
When he was in a healthy state of mind, we had a few conversations.

Suddenly, a light came into his eyes. It was as if something had jumped on board. no ,
I wonder if this is his original appearance.

Diores and I were like completely different people. The look of a warrior has returned.

`On rare occasions, you will find one sitting alone in a corner of a weapons or goods store.

I don't even know if that was the case. The man in front of me now is the same man I saw when I first met him.
It was so bad that it was hard to tell if it was real or not.

Next, I asked him if there was a temple in Yeh Ender's cave. some

As he tried to spit out the last words, a glint of madness appeared in his eyes.
It was brightly lit. Apparently he dedicated human corpses to the temple.

There are also some. Do you know? Dogs and cats and falling objects are cursed.
This means that you can judge whether something is wrong or not. They are the only ones who feel the curse.
It will even give off a tantalizing odor. They walk on things that are cursed.
I don't think so. The priests can smell the scent of holy power as well.
I don't know if it's just that.''

Diores let out a sly smile at the corners of her mouth. My nerves are disgusting
My hair stood up all over, and a chill ran down my spine.

He drank a lot of alcohol here. Drunkenness made his tongue smooth and shattered.
It's like my mind is being reshaped, if only temporarily.

Let's go. As a researcher of demon caves, there are many things that interest me, but I myself am interested in such things.
I never thought I'd try the experience.

Food situation in the devil's cave

Res's mental state was relatively good. These days he comes to greet me.
And there are. It seems like his mind has been reorganized by our conversation.

That day, I asked Diores about the food situation in the Demon Cave. Somewhat
It seems like there's a lot of space to bring in food, but it's several dozen stories underground.
Be sure to bring all the food you need for the number of days it takes to traverse the Gender Cave.

It's almost impossible.

⑫&e The question in this room was easily solved by Diores' answer.
`Don't you know that most of the monsters in the devil's cave are eaten?
There are shops selling goods, and food can be found here and there. It is possible to get sufficient nutrition.
However, it is also difficult to get carried away from time to time. Well, I'm hungry

It didn't seem that bad. However, I will eat your meat.
I have no intention of eating it.

Furthermore, Diores gave some valuable information about the taste of monster meat.

According to him, acquiring these abilities is definitely going to happen.
It's not like there's anything wrong with that, and the outcome seems to depend on luck. Also, the individual monsters are powerful.
