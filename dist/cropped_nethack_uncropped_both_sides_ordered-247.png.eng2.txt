I met a man called Diores.

He lived under a bridge, near the slums. Makes me want to call home
His home was a hovel shop like that. I wish I were a warrior who was as successful as him.
A luxurious mansion should be built. However, his spirit itself
Maybe it was because he wanted to live in the same place as him.

The place I am about to visit is the residence of a man named Diores.

Until a few years ago, he was a well-known barbarian. He was proud of his huge body and held it in his hand.
It is said to boast that it can cut through anything with a great sword.

There is no way for me, except God, to know what kind of fear attacked him.

However, there was a problem with the game of Go.

The spirit of Diores was shattered and scattered in the demon cave of Yesterday. Since then, this hut
He has been holed up in a tree, cut off contact with humans, and lived in darkness. Mare town
He went out and sold the treasure he had found in Yender's Cave for 2,000 yen and made a living.
