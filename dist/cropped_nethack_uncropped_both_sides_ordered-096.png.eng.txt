When the treasure chest is opened, it is unlikely that the player will put anything inside.
The ingenuity of the drawings is in the use of invasive tools such as a bucket, holdens, and backpacks (especially the "2" and "3" buckets, respectively).
The total weight of the backpacks is much lower than that of the traditional backpacks. )
It is common when using the sinker and bagg (â‘§), so it is good to remember them.

Nasrullah is only super hungry.

It has been a long time since she lost her last meal. It is a long way to the grocery store. First of all, we had no money.
We searched for food on this floor, but there was no food to be found. We had to search for water and water supplies.
We could find some water, but there was no way we could stomach it.

They needed food, especially meat. They needed meat.

If I didn't, I would get dizzy and collapse.
I need to ask for help. Please, anything you want, just come out.

Holding her stomach, the woman saw a door in front of her as she tried to get out of the cave.

Her anticipation is high. It is a common occurrence that a monster appears just after opening the door of a room.
It's a story. In one case, the monster attacked him and he was seriously injured. If you get it right, you can get two of them.
There may be two or three of them if things go well. No, as long as they abused their hunger, any number of them would do.
If they abused their hunger, any number of them would have been fine. I could use all kinds of magic and items to defeat the demons.
I was loyal to him.

Nasrullah leaned against the door. Nasrullah takes a deep breath and opens the door.

The house was not very spacious. Instinctively she looked around the room and saw no sign of the monster.
She could not see the monster.

For a moment, it seemed as if her expectations had been betrayed.

(Is that a joke?)

I feel weak and weak all over my body.

However, when she hears a growling voice coming from the back of the room, her expression brightens.
Her face lightened up. She saw something in front of Nasrullah's history, at a point far away from her.
She saw something. There it was. It was Jhakkar. Red eyes shining, copper fangs bared, he was intimidating her.
It was a jackal, red eyes shining, copper fangs bared, threatening the woman.
