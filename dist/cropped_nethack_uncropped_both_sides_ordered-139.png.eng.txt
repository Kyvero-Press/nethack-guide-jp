7 ON state)

Then, if you press (@) key once more, the pickup will be in the OFF state and you can use the eye-tracking function.
If you do not press the (@) key, you will not be able to pick up the pickup without pressing the (@) key again. In other words, @ every time you press the key, the beeper will be turned off.
In other words, each time the @ key is pressed, the QN/QFF of the bit up cycles in sequence.
QN and QFF of the bic-ap are cycled in sequence as you press the @ key.

The pickup ON state may indeed be convenient, but some ITEMs have a problem with the QN and QFF of the pickup.
However, some of the items can cause disasters just by being removed, so I wouldn't recommend it to beginners.
However, some of the items can cause disasters just by being discharged, so I would not recommend them to novice users.
