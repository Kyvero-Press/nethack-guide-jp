NETHACK GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
(Copyright 1989 M. Stephenson)

(Based on the BISON general public license,
copyright 1988 Richard M. Stallman)

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license,
but changing it is not allowed. You can also use this wording to make the
terms for other programs.

The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy
of those companies. By contrast, our general public license is intended to give
everyone the right to share NetHack. To make sure that you get the rights
we want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. Hence this license

agreement.

Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away
copies of NetHack, that you receive source code or else can get it if you want
it, that you can change NetHack or use pieces of it in new free programs, and
that you know you can do these things.

To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights. For example, if you distribute copies of
NetHack, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must
tell them their rights.

Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out
that there is no warranty for NetHack. If NetHack is modified by someone
else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not
what we distributed.

Therefore we (Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights)
make the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to
distribute or change NetHack.

COPYING POLICIES

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of NetHack source code as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you keep intact the notices on all
files that refer to copyrights, to this License Agreement, and to the absence
of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack program a
copy of this License Agreement along with the program.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of NetHack or any portion of it, and
copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above
(including distributing this License Agreement), provided that you also do the
following:

⑧ cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
changed the files and the date of any change; and

b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
or in part contains or is a derivative of NetHack or any part thereof, to be
licensed at no charge to all third parties on terms identical to those contained
in this License Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more
extensive warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option)

ら You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of transferring a
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for
a fee.

3. You may copy and distribute NetHack (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

a) accompany it with the complete machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

b) accompany it with full information as to how to obtain the complete
machine-readable source code from an appropriate archive site. (This alterna-

tive is allowed only for noncommercial distribution.)

For these purposes, complete source code means either the full source

distribution as originally released over Usenet or updated copies of the files
in this distribution used to create the object code or executable.

4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack except as
expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any attempt otherwise to
copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack is void and your rights to use
the program under this License agreement shall be automatically terminated.
However, parties who have received computer software programs from you
with this License Agreement will not have their licenses terminated so long

as such parties remain in full compliance.

Stated plainly: You are prohibited by the terms of this License Agreement
from using NetHack for gainful purposes. You are permitted to modify
NetHack, or otherwise use parts of NetHack, provided that you comply with
the conditions specified above; in particular, your modified NetHack or
program containing parts of NetHack must remain freely available as pro-
vided in this License Agreement. In other words, go ahead and share NetH-
ack, but don’t try to stop anyone else from sharing it farther.

Method of Infringement of Attached Disks

iist

The nethacks included in the accompanying disks in this document have been modified in various ways, so it is not possible to play them with floppy disks.
The nethacks in the accompanying diskettes in this book have been modified in various ways, so it is not possible to play them with floppy disks.
It is possible, but nearly impossible in practice, to play on the floppy disk. It is not impossible, but it is close to impractical.
If you want to play on the Internet, you will need to have a Hack or EMS.
Let's go over how to prepare to play the hack.

Requirements

Req 臺

Items required to play the nethack stored in the attached disk.
There are several items that are required.

First, let's list what is absolutely necessary.

First, PC-⑨⑧0① VF or later with main memory of ⑥④0 KB or more is absolutely necessary.
This is absolutely necessary. In other words, a PC with a CPU of V30 or higher (9), 8), 0①, 0①, 0①, and 1) is absolutely necessary.
In other words, PC-89⑧0① series with V30 or higher CPU and PC-②⑧⑥/③⑧⑥/④⑧⑥ series are sufficient. The following two series are available.
The models released within the past two years should be sufficient.

And, MS-DOS version (3) or later is required. The MS-DOS version (3) or later is required.

Next, we will list what we would like to have if possible. First, a hard disk.
The accompanying disk for this document includes background music and CG images for the Nethack.
The accompanying disk of this book also contains background music and image CG for the Nethack, so in order to retain them, a floppy disk would require two discs.
The first set contains the BGM and image CGs for the movie, and the second set contains the BGM and image CGs for the movie.

In addition, an additional memory that can be used as an EMS and a corresponding EMS driver would be a nice addition to the system.
If there is an EMS driver for the EMS and an additional memory that can be used as an EMS, it would be a good choice. The nethack is not necessarily stuck without it, but it does slow it down.
The nethack would be slow and almost unplayable in practice.

In the meantime, you will want to be sure to have an English-Japanese dictionary and a large number of other useful documents available.

Co: Constitutional Lifeforms
The higher the Constitution, the more advantageous it is to withstand physical exhaustion or escape the effects of poison.
The higher the level of substitution, the more advantageous it is. The higher the level of commitment, the better the chance of escaping the toxic effects of the poison.
The higher the cost structure, the greater the benefit.

As a result, we would expect a large value for the cost of construction. Muscle
The reason is that a physically weak warrior, even with a superior muscle mass, would be a laughable proposition.

Ch : Charisma Charisma charm
The presence or absence of charisma is directly related to the price of the owners of the stores in the brothels of the Jews.
The price of a product is the same as the price of the owner of the shop who owns the shop in the Yeenderer's cave.
The more attractive the buyer is, the more they will sell the item at a lower price.

Incidentally, the carisma is not only a visual element; it can also be a human (e.g., an elf or some other monster).
It refers to the overall attractiveness of a person (who may be an elf or other star). The overall attractiveness of the product as an elf (or possibly other motors) is the overall attractiveness of the product.

The great sword falls through the air with a roar.

Elf fists the sword above her head to block the waiting woman's slash. But the movement is too late.
But it is too late. Nasrullah's flash slips past Elf's defenses and lands a blow on her left shoulder.
WZ AT,

Blue blood drenches Nasrullah's cheek and stirrup.

[B. Bon]

Elf swung his sword in counterattack, but he had no strength. But he has no more strength. Nasrullah's sword
He could have taken it in a minute with Nasrullah's sword. If he had been a little further ahead, he would have been able to stop him,
If he had stopped him a little earlier, he would have been blown away by the wall of the cave.

Nasrullah sheathed Elf's sword and continued his assault. He gave a hard thrust and then struck with a flanker's cleave.
Nasrullah then flicked his sword to the side.

S

Elf grunts. He had expected a direct hit, but the tip of the sword grazed the area near the wound.
The sword had been too weak for him to have been able to move. It was not the same Elf's body movements as before. His natural swordsmanship had been lost.
The original swordsmanship had been lost. |The sword was not the same as it had been in the past.

The only thing that matters is the time of the day.
| The only thing that is left is the sword.

Nasrullah shouted, "You can't win.
You will never win. You can't win, it's useless to fight.
What is the use of fighting? What is wasteful? The game is not over yet. What is wasteful?
I am not the one to be beaten by you.

The elf held up his sword. The dark green sword glinted faintly.
I am Nevaeh, a warrior of Dark Elves and head of the Hive Perion Cavalry.
I am Nevaeh. How can I surrender to a mere mortal?

Nevaeh Vi, his upper body stained with blue blood, attacked. He swung his sword high in the air.

Nasrullah waved his sword. The blood that clung to the sword splatters on the floor.
5) "Do not ... do not mock mankind!

Elf moved his mouth, but no words of rebuttal came out of it. He broke his arm.
He fell without holding his arms. With a dull thud, he collapsed.

Nasrullah walks slowly toward him. Elf's body rapidly loses warmth.
The lights were going out. The creature that had been breathing, thinking, and talking until a few moments before, was now sick in a sickle.
The creatures that had been breathing, thinking, and talking just a few moments before had become as inorganic as a sickle or a sword.
| The creature that had been sucking, thinking, and talking had become as inorganic as a sickle or a sword.
Nasrullah did not say, "She has been turned into a sword. She had to achieve her goal at all costs.
She had to achieve her goal at all costs. Dark Elf had come and fought against her. He would not let Nasrullah's evil do this to her.
If only he had not done the evil of Nasrullah, he would not be dead.

Nasrullah picked up the knife that had just been at her throat.
(No, it would have been you who would have been killed.)

Dark Elf was the strongest of all the enemies she had fought in Dungeon. He was the best of all the opponents Waitress had fought in dungeon.
He was superior in every way: skill, strength, and experience. Nasrullah was able to win because
Nasrullah won only because he underestimated people. If he had not thought about playing with them, he would not have won.

The labyrinth

Only a thin gown covers the body of Teeke, who is no longer a child.
The only thing covering Tique's body, who is no longer a child in the labyrinth, is a thin sheet of 1.

All that Teeke was wearing was a mountain of dust, and it was a pile of dirt under her feet.
All of the items that T'Keh was wearing were piled up in a heap at his feet.

The smooth silk gowns allowed the lines of her body to show through.
The lines of Teeke's body were clearly visible through the smooth silk gown.

"Hmmm..." Hm..."

Teeke chokes weakly and regains consciousness.

Between blinks (2, 3), she realized the situation she was in, and moved her body to the side.
L, ③.

Tique's upper body rose up and the gown slid down from her chest. The gown slid down from her chest.
There are many cherry-red patches from her chest to her neck.
Teeke grabbed Gaun tightly and pulled her to her chest.

Her body was completely cold. I thought it was a dream that she had been so hot just a few days ago.
It was almost as if it had been a dream. But I was not so sure that it was not a dream.
But her body remembered that it was not a dream.

48 COMMANDS 1 To Walk Through the Cave ......

It was the first time that Tiecke had ever known such a pleasant sensation.

A rapturous feast from the depths of her body assaulted her consciousness, and she continued to scream incomprehensible words into the air, lost in her own mind.
The intense joy that welled up from deep within her body assaulted her consciousness, making her yell out incomprehensible words without a care in the world.

Suddenly, Tätike looked for the gown and threw it away.

She reaches for a pile of clothes in the corner and stops to look at a spell book that has fallen next to it.
His line of sight stops at the spell book that has fallen beside it.

Ek.

While she was trying to memorize the spell book, Aitsu came to her.

It was a humanoid monster called an incubus.

While she was concentrating her spirit to learn a new spell, Teeke was attacked by an Inkyubus that approached her from behind.
She did not notice the incubus approaching from behind her. The door to the room was not closed at all.
The door to the room was not closed at all, because most of the people in the room were not in the room until the door was closed.
Most mongers or miki-something madmen will know the first blow is taken and will be able to counterattack.
They will be able to counterattack.

However, Reynkjubas did not attack Tjike, but instead finished him off.

Teiche does as he is told, throws away his weapons, grips his stirrups, and .......

Biting his lip, he rose to his feet.

Silently, he puts on his shirts and picks up his padded mail from the floor.
Inexplicably, she felt as if she were becoming lighter. I had a bowl of fortified cookies that I had eaten a long time ago.
On a piece of paper that had been in a fondue cookie I had eaten a long time ago, I read that the inky baths kill those who like them, and that the ones who like them better are the ones who get the most out of them.
I wonder if it is true.
Teeke wondered, while wearing the stirrups, if this was true.

He strapped his shield to his left arm and lowered his mace to his waist. He wanted to find the spring and get to the bottom of his body.
B, moreover, (8) there was something I needed to be bald about.

After locking the two doors of the house with a wardrobe, Teeke sat down on the floor.
After locking the two doors of the house with the wand, Täche sat down on the floor. She places the spellbook she had just finished reading on her lap.

It is a good idea to use it. By the time you reach the midpoint of the game, you should have several scrolls in your possession.

The benefits of reading a scroll are immediately apparent. Unlike words and rings, scrolls have a clear effect.
(5) Unlike words and rings, the effects of scrolls are often clear, even if you read something unknown to you,
If you read something you don't know, it will probably be registered in the identification list displayed on the front page. Before identification
The first time the scroll is labeled with an unintelligible label, but after it has been identified for a while, the label will be changed to a meaningful name.
After a few identifications, the name changes to something meaningful.

If you try to read a spell book, it will take you a certain amount of time to finish it. During that time, the spell book will also change to "Monstar".
During this time, the monsters will move around and attack, so learning the spells is not an easy task.
It is better to learn the spell in a closed space. If you should stop reading in the middle of a spell, the spell book will not be able to help you.
If you stop reading halfway through, the spellbook will not disappear. Don't worry.

All spellbooks have a difficulty level, and there is a guideline for the level required to master the spells.

To convert to the knight's level, multiply by 2 and subtract 1. For the highest level spell (7), multiply by (2) and subtract (1),
The highest level spell (7) can be learned at experience level 13. The intelligence value is also important.
Low-level characters will have a hard time. High-level spells are not easy to memorize.
If a character tries to learn a high-level spell by any means and fails to master it, he or she may be teleported or cursed.
If you try to memorize a high-level spell and fail to learn it, you may end up teleporting or being cursed (⑥), or having a variety of (unintended) g) results or LIRS, LIRS, LIRS to appear.

Once a spell is learned, it is used by expending Pw corresponding to its magic power. After several uses, the spell `stops working.

Nasrullah went down the stairs to check on his equipment. So far, he had managed to get rid of all the eye-tracks.

That's why. We had already confirmed that it was Sook-yu's medicine, but the rest remained unidentified.
The other remained unidentified. The red, blue, and green liquid in the bottles were all very bright, but the color and the effect were not always in direct proportion.
The color was not proportional to the effect. If it was a strong drug or a paralytic, it could be fatal.

(It is no use carrying something so useless, though.)

Nasrullah thought that it was useless, but he could not bring himself to throw it away. If I could use the confirmation spell, I would be able to find out who she really was.
If I could use the confirmation spell, I would know for sure who she was. Perhaps there was a drug I could use.
Perhaps there was a medicine that could be used.

(I'm sorry, but I'm not ready...)

With a sigh, Nasrullah finally rechecked his weapons and gear against the remaining amount of food.
The stirrups were on the ground floor (6). The stirrups were freshly purchased plate mail from the 6th floor below ground.
As they were brand new, there was not a scratch on them. The shield he had taken with him when he came down to the grotto.
The shield was the small shield I had brought with me when I descended into the grotto. It had been sealed up with magic, so it had good protection.
However, it was damaged in many places, probably from overuse.

And the sword. The sword is the legendary Stormbringer. It was given to her by Loki, the god who watches over her.

Nasrullah felt that his steps were getting heavier. Just one step forward
(1) Just to take one step forward requires the same amount of effort as (3) to (4) steps forward. I was out of breath just by taking 0 steps, and I had to rest for every 0 steps.
(3) Every 0 steps requires a rest.

(I picked up too much stuff, didn't I?)

Whenever I see something I can use, I tend to pick it up. I'm too lazy to do anything else.
I have unidentified medicines and other scrolls clinging to various parts of my body. I have tried many times to sort them out.
I tried many times to sort them out, but I could never bring myself to throw them away.

However, if the baggage continued to pile up, it would become an obstacle to our movement. In some cases, it could be fatal.
It could be life-threatening in some cases.
We have no choice. I'll just throw some away.

The first thing to do is to find a treasure stone. Nasrullah had a large number of blue, red, green, and white stones.
Nasrullah had to get rid of them. She had grown up in a world where stones were not associated with her, so she did not know the names of the stones.

(If only Lapsi had been there at that time...)

Nasrullah thought of his friend from the orphanage.

Lapsi was one of her closest friends at the orphanage, partly because they shared the same dormitory room.

She was knowledgeable, especially when it came to gemstones and medicine, and few losers could match her.

Oh, that's Ruby. Don't be so rough with her.

[Z, don't you dare!
That's just a red ball of gas.

Lavishly, he said the name of the stone at the first glance and never missed once.
How do you know it's a red glass ball?
How do you know? How do you know?

Nasrullah asked repeatedly, but Lapusi only laughed and did not answer.
I don't think so.

To identify a gem, one must know the real gem as well as the forgery.
It is impossible to do so without a good knowledge of the real thing. An eye that knows the real thing will be able to detect forgeries, not the other way around.

Nasrullah somehow knew that Lavrushti came from a high class background.
Nasrullah had no idea that Lapsi was from a high class background. But Lapsi never revealed her past, nor did she seem inclined to do so.
He didn't seem to want to. Therefore, he did not ask her about her past.

We remained friends and she taught me many things about jewels and medicines. ...... I should have.
I think I'm right.

However, when I actually went into the cave to identify it, I could not understand it at all.
Even now, the yellowish color is still there. I still have a few shiny brown stones with a yellowish tinge, but I am not sure if they are just glass beads or not.
I could never tell if they were just glass balls, topaz, or ambers.
I was not sure if they were just glass balls, topaz, or ambers. If they were topaz or ambers, we would have had to take them to a specialty store, where we could get them back at a very reasonable price.
If they were topaz or ambers, we could take them to a specialty store, which would take them back for a very reasonable price. But if it was a glass ball, it would be worth nothing. It would be evil.
They are just evil.

The two are lost.

But he made up his mind quickly.

(There was no need to risk his life for a product that he did not know whether it would be sold or not.
)

She abandoned all of her treasures. She watched as the stones rolled away from her.
Nasrullah watched them roll away. Nasrullah watched the stones roll away.

Next came the medicine. Cleave could not understand it either. He smelled the same as Lavpusy.
He tried to smell the same as Lapsi, but he could not have a moment's pause. It was not enough to make me sleepy.

He had no hallucinations.

All in all, the woman's medications were unidentifiable items, in all but name, except for a levitation drug and a curative.
She had nothing but unidentifiable items. Some were cleavers, others were poisons. Unidentified
There is nothing more frightening than an unidentified Cleave. I brought it with me, thinking I could use it to check my equipment.
I brought it with me, thinking I could use it to check my equipment, but somehow it turned out to be nothing more than baggage.

(Damn, I should have thrown this away, too.)

I had to get rid of all the nasulullahs except for the ones I knew who they were. If we had any luck, we would take them out at the end of the day.
If we were lucky, we might be able to pick them up at the end of the day.

(I should have asked Lapsi a little more about this.)

Nasrullah looked at the pile of treasure stones and cleaves and sighed.
Nasrullah sighed. It's pathetic, I know. It was the kind of thing an insolent person would think of.

But the fact was that it seemed too good to be true.

Nasrullah turned his back to the door. Nasrullah turned his back on the door, intending to follow his master's words to the letter.

But his foot would not go through the door.

He was not a foe that could be defeated if he fought properly.

(However, a surprise attack might help.)

The best way to get money was to find a safe, but he had no teleportation scrolls or magic maps.
But without teleportation scrolls or magic maps, it would be difficult.

Nasrullah also preferred to use his left hand as a pick-up.

Avoid danger if at all possible.

This is the golden rule of the adventurer. It is the rule of the adventurous, as Reverend Neal Nehru always said. In the interest of immediate profit, we should not risk our own lives.
Do not risk your life for the sake of immediate gain. It may seem far-fetched, but it is true.

It is the shorter, safer path. It is too late to do anything after death,
The time of death is too late for everything, and the time of life is too late for everything.

The Nasrullah's funds are hard, but not so hard that it is a matter of life and death.
It would be foolish to lose one's life for the sake of a mere scroll.

(I'm being honest here.)

Her reason told her, "I am a fool and a fool to lose my life for the sake of a scroll.

She was lost. Her thoughts raced back and forth between conflicting choices. She was trying to settle down.
She would not settle down.

To open or not to open? That was the question.

But Nasrullah's balance tended to be more emotional than rational.

Her blood was the blood of an adulterer. I know it's dangerous. But we must avoid danger.
But avoiding danger is not the only way to proceed. He had to be more afraid of danger than anything else.

Nasrullah thinks.

She puts her hand on the door.

She takes a deep breath and opens the door.

Nasrullah jumps into the room, and the monster's gaze is drawn to her. A strange scream is heard.
The monsters in their chairs stand up. Orc gripped his sword and began to threaten the monsters.
The monster's face was red and his eyes were wide open.

Nasrullah put up the cooking wand. The wand glows vermilion.

Sometimes, despite the fact that there was a room in front of them, they could not enter or proceed.

The first time I saw the two hands, I was surprised to see them. The hand that was supposed to be holding the katana had turned into a clenched fist.
The hand that was supposed to be holding Katana had become a clenched fist.

However, when he looked around, he saw that Katana was not the only one who had disappeared.

The child, the dragon hand, and even the crystalline platemail he had worked so hard to obtain were gone.
The only thing that remained was a preventative measure. The only protective gear that remained was a pair of boots up to the knees. The back pack-back was gone.
Even the puck back had become light.
I see... I've met Kink.

Perhaps with a little effort, Jositne slumped to the floor. I couldn't regret it.
He was so sorry that he couldn't even regret it.

Nymphs, whose beauty has been celebrated in countless sculptures, paintings, and poems, are a symbol of the world's most beautiful people.
The highest form of beauty is the art of the artist. Women with the highest qualities of beauty, conscious of their own beauty, disciplined to the utmost limits, and with a strong sense of self-worth, are the most important people in the world today.
Even if a woman with the highest qualities of beauty is aware of her own beauty and trains herself to the utmost limit, she will never be able to match the magical beauty of the nymphs.
Nymph's beauty is not to be found in the written word. The beauty of the Nymphs is beyond description, and no carving, no painting, no drawing, no painting can match their beauty.
No sculpture, painting, or poem can compare to the beauty of a nymph.

The survey was very beautiful.

Yoshitsune was charmed by the girl at the first sight of her. Not even an eyebrow moved.
She could not move an eyebrow, nor did she allow the mischievous Nymph to take his katana or remove his helmet.
He allowed the naughty nymph to take his katana, to remove his helmet, and to pull the dragon's hand from his arm. No, I had to forgive him.
I could not.

"Ah!"

Josine sighed heavily.

It is also a fact that the "no" in the "no" column is not a "no" column.

In realization, Jositne closed his eyes and placed the index finger of his right hand on his forehead. His lips curled.
A strange word escapes from his lips. He continued chanting, and soon a hot mass seeped out from inside his body.
I continued chanting and immediately felt a hot mass rising up from within my body.

I opened my eyes. I opened my eyes and saw the nymphs approaching me. I saw something suspicious about Yoshine's behavior.
He was slowing down slightly, as if he sensed something suspicious about Josine's behavior. However, Jo was not happy.
However, Jositne's chanting did not stop.

He flipped his hand back and raised it high. The chanting stopped, and there was a shout that could neither be described as a spirit nor a yell.
A shout, which could neither be described as a shout nor a spirit, emanated from the mouth of (3) Shitsune. The tip of his finger caught the nymph firmly in his hand,
The moment when the tip of the finger caught the nymph. An eagle ray of light shot out from Yoshitsune's fingertips.

A torrent of light rips through the sky and is absorbed into Nymph's body.

Nymph screams inaudibly and collapses.

From nowhere on his body came a flurry of punches and dragon hands.
| The body was so strong that he fell down. The two men were then in a state of shock.

The first time I saw him, he dropped to his knees. The unaccustomed magic chanting and the concentration required for it took a toll on his physical strength.
The unaccustomed magic chanting and the concentration required to perform it were reducing his strength to an almost frightening degree.
If I can do it, I'm going to do it again.

While talking to himself under his raspy breath, Yoshitsune kept repeating the spell in his head.
I don't want you to be a magician," he said under his breath.
A magic missile. I might be able to use it, depending on the occasion.

The magic spells memorized by reading the grimoire can be used in the command (7).
The list of spells in the memory is indicated by (xJ) or (Sat).

Each time a spell is used, the memory of the spell fades (casting the spell is not a "magic").
), and eventually the spell will be lost in the memory.
The spell will eventually disappear from memory.

Also, when you cast a spell, you may be asked to input the direction in which the spell is cast.
In this case, the attacker is asked to cast a spell. In this case, offensive spells require a movement key in the direction of the enemy, while spells to cast a spell on yourself require a movement key in the direction of the enemy.

The following is a list of the tools that can be used in the application process.

Nasrullah felt heaven and earth turn upside down. The feet were weak and the knees were bent. Arms
(3) I could not help but fall off balance. Fell on his back.
Nasrullah's vision is strangely distorted as he lies on his face. Her sense of balance was off.

It was impossible to see. I thought I had checked everything, but some strange food was missing.
e

My arms and legs were cramped and I couldn't move freely. Her vision is distorted. Tinnitus.

Fortunately, his thinking is clear. The degree of defeat is low.
It's a good thing. It did not seem to have been fatally damaged.

(If you can lie back a little ..... )

I thought about the Brelator and the other two. I was thinking more like a maniac, but I was not sure if it was a maniac or not.

(If the monster comes, there's no way I'm going to get out of here.)

I was going to laugh, but even my lips didn't move.

I felt bad. I hadn't felt this way since my days at the orphanage, when I got a hangover from drinking too much alcohol.
It was the first time I had ever felt that way. That was the first time I drank alcohol, so I didn't know where the limit was.
I didn't know exactly where the limit was. I was so intoxicated by the thunderstorm that Liffey and Lovesey could not stop me.
I was so intoxicated by the thunderstorm that I drank two bottles of wine without the help of a riffraff or a lavvy to stop me. The next day, I couldn't move, so I lay there on my face.
The next day, he was motionless, lying on his back.

It would take him a long time to recover. I was as sad as Kya that my senses had gone awry.

He was screaming like Gia.

A flicker, and then the vision drops again, and the contours of the object become clearer. A high-pitched growl.
The high-pitched humming slowly subsides, and silence returns. ...... The sun is shining and the sun is shining.
There should be nothing around Te Sulu La.

But Nasrullah's ears caught it. The sound of what sounded like footsteps was heard at .......

(What's there?)

64 COMMANDS To Walk Through the Peephole .......

There is no chance of encountering anyone other than Nasrullah in this vast cavern. If you hear footsteps, it is most likely a monster.
If there were footsteps, they were clearly those of a monster. However, they were very close. It was either in the same room or it was not.
The two of them must have been in the same room, or at least a wall away from each other.

I tried to say a few words of warning, but my voice failed to register.

(Not good, and I can't even use the horns of my unicorn.)

The unicorn horn is a magical item. The unicorn horn is a magical item that removes mortal illness, hallucinations, blindness, and aura.
The Unicorn Horn can remove mortal illnesses, hallucinations, restlessness, and all kinds of disabilities. With the use of even a unicorn horn, you can use the magic of the magic of the unicorn horn to cure any condition of health.
With even a unicorn horn, you can return to a healthy body.

However, the freedom of the limbs has not yet been restored. She is struggling to put strength into her arms.
He tries desperately to exert strength in his arms, but he can only faintly move his fingertips. It is only a short distance to the corner of the unicorn that is placed on her waist.
The distance to the corner of the unicorn was only a short distance, but it was as if a wall of diamonds had been built.
The corner of the unicorn was only a short distance away, and it was as if the wall was made of diamonds.

The monster's roar was getting closer and closer. There was no doubt that they were in the same room.
I don't doubt that they are in the same room.

(. The monster's roar is ever nearer, and no one doubts that it is in the same room.)

On a hunch, Nasrullah moves his finger.

Nasrullah felt the touch of a medicine bottle on the tip of his finger. The corner of the unicorn was below it.

But that was all. Nasrullah could no longer move his fingers.
Nasrullah could no longer move her finger. The monster was looking down at her.

She had no idea who the monster was. But no matter how weak the monster was, she could not see it now.
But no matter how weak the monster is, it is a more formidable enemy than the dragon.

(Until the end of time? )

She, too, has come to her senses.

However, contrary to her expectations, there was no attack. The monster in question was seen as an adventurer.
The monster saw us as an enemy and attacked us without hesitation. Let it be by the sword or by the fangs.
The monster was not a monster without a sword or fangs.

(If you are interested in ...... )

The monster may be lost. The monster may be lost.
The monster may think that the motionless adventurer is dead. Except for monsters like jackals, which feed on dead bodies, the dead are not considered dead.
No one except monsters that feed on dead bodies, such as the jakkals, would take a dead body as a partner. And a monster with intelligence, such as an elf, would not be a good partner for a dead body.

Nasrullah did not move an inch. He could not inhale, let alone breathe, and every muscle in his body stopped moving.
Every muscle in his body stopped moving, let alone breathing. He took advantage of his immobility and pretended to be dead.
LES W30k,

Nasrullah's bet paid off. The monster was watching her closely,
But finally he left.

Again, Nasrullah moved his finger. Something hard touched her fingertips.
(Zau3)

She grabbed it reflexively and pulled it out in a single motion. (Zau3) She grabbed it reflexively and pulled it away.
(Zau3) She forcefully lifted her arm and clamped it against her forehead. Because of the lack of full sensation in his hand, the tip of the antler stuck in his finger.
The tip of the antler was sticking into his finger because he could not fully feel his hand. He found that his paralysis was so severe that he felt no pain at all.
The tip of the antler was stuck in his finger. However, what he pulled out was definitely a unicorn horn.

Nasrullah felt the horns of the unicorn absorb the paralysis itself.
Nasrullah felt the numbness itself being absorbed. At the same time, his fingers began to ache.

(I can do it.)

She grabbed her sword and stood up. The monster turned around and looked at her.

The first time the two women saw each other, they gave a small scream.

At the very least, there would be a few spalls on the blade. However, I did not want to wipe it off.
If he thought he could wipe it off, he would get burned. For Yoshitne,
Yoshine had no choice but to stand back and watch.

After a few moments, the smoke finally subsided. I lightly shook the katana back and forth to check the balance.
The center of gravity had clearly shifted. This is not just a matter of blade-splitting, but also a matter of how to avoid being killed by the enemy.
It would be difficult to hit the enemy.

The first time I saw a dog, I had just met a Uruk-hai and was half-dead.

I'll never forget that sickening breath of his. ......

Yoshikine had a lightning flash wand on her hip, which she had mistakenly used to reveal her true identity, and she was now a man of the world.
I took one look at the magic sealed inside. The wand was a powerful lightning bolt that could be used to unleash the magic contained in the wand.
The Wand could have lost all of its magic power.
No. Can it still be used? No. Can it still be used?

The moment I thought that, the door opened. In the darkness, I saw (5) Uruk-hai.
In the darkness, I saw (5) Uruk-hai. Yoshikine pulled the wand out of the holder on her hip and waved it in a reflective motion.

The wand burned in Jositne's palm.

A large flash of light exploded.

The only one left in the house was a Uruk-hai, which had been half-desiccated.

What is the reason for this?

As with other ITEMs, the immediate wand is the same as any other wand.

It is not clear what the properties of the wand will be immediately after it is acquired. In fact, the "effect is `no effect at all'.

Nasrullah was sure that the house at the end of the platform was there.

However, what she sees in front of her is just a stone wall. There was no door.

It was obvious to him that he was going to be Ogre's food.

She faced the loam.
Is it over?

Nasrullah recalled the words of Master Nealco.

As a potter, Nealco had explored many unexplored places, including the China Rock Sea.
After his retirement, he continued to be very successful in teaching the gastroenterologist.
His students include Neal Kutik, who explored Mount Eclipses, Faramond Cave, and the Grotto of Faramond.
The cave is the site of the famous Faramond Cave, which was discovered by the famous adventurer Lojarchi Rezjar.
The cave is home to a number of well-known scoundrels, including Roi Yalchi-Renzi, who revealed the whole story of the cave.

His teacher at the School for the Adversary in Nasrullah was also a conqueror. Neal Luko was a master of the skills necessary to be a blasphemer.
He taught me the skills necessary to be a blasphemer. The skills he taught me are perfectly useful in the cave.
The techniques that he taught me are perfectly useful in the cave. Without his skills, it would have been impossible to survive in the cave.
He would not be able to survive in the grotto without his skills.

On the occasion of his graduation from the training school, he gave a final instruction to all graduates: "Don't give up.
Never give up.

He looked into the eyes of his brothers and sisters.
In the cave, the one who gives up is the loser. Even if you have little strength left, you will be trapped by the monsters.
Even if you are surrounded by monsters and you are doomed to extinction, you must not give up.]

Xiexian Xiaozuo

Nasrullah raised his hand. Nasrullah's friends looked at him with a stern look on their faces. Nasrullah looked at his friends with a scrutinizing look on their faces.
It was the most impolite thing to interrupt a teacher in an adult school. Some teachers would even say that they were being evil.
Some teachers would even beat up a student who had misinterpreted what they were saying. However, Master Nealko had a faint feeling that it was only Kamimine Fuchi who was being treated with such disrespect.
It was only at Kambo Fuchi.
What is it?
I have a question.
I have a question.
I think it is important not to give up, as you said. However, I really don't know how to do that.
However, there are times when there is really nothing we can do. For example, there are times when a monster surrounds you in all directions.
For example, when you are surrounded in all directions by monsters and there is no way to escape. There are times when fighting is futile.

I would be lying if I said I wasn't afraid of death. But I didn't want to die a painful death.

But her way of thinking changed when she entered the real cave. She no longer wanted to die.
She no longer wanted to die. I don't know why. She only knew that she had seen the remains of a person who had died in a dark cave without being seen.
The more I looked at the remains of those who had died without being seen, the more I became afraid. I didn't want to be like that. I wanted to live as long as I could.
I wanted to stay alive and go above ground at all costs.

An obsession grew in Nasrullah's heart.
Is it worth it?

Nasrullah whispered and inspected the wall. Nasrullah grinds the lehenga and digs at his swimsuit. R
Nasrullah mumbles and examines the wall.

It was only a few moments later that she found the pull of the hidden door.

If a staircase could not be found in the Yerender's cave, or if a vendor's store could not be found, then the woman would have to go to the store to find the right one.
If you can't find a staircase in Yerender's Grotto, it's likely that you missed a hidden door or a hidden passageway.

This is when e-command is used. In places where a door or passage is likely to be hidden, the (s) key is used.
In many cases, it is difficult to see the door or passageway, so it is best to use the e-command as many times as you wish.
Let's try the e-command as many times as we can. If you input "n I0s", you will get a zero-cause connection.
You can continue searching.

Also, the elves will automatically check walls and paths without the need to enter an e-command.
They can also check walls and corridors automatically without having to input an e-command. They have the psychic ability to detect the slightest irregularity in walls and corridors.
However, they are not infallible, so do not be overconfident. I thought it was funny.
Let's try using a command that I thought was interesting. Only elves have the ability to search from birth.
Only the elves have the ability to search, but archaeologists, thieves, and (why not?) turists have the ability to search by experience.

Tiket was carrying a corpse that was twice as big as his own body.
It was one of the two Frost Giants that had been killed in a nearby house. The body was one of several flotsam and jetsam that had been caught at a nearby house.
There was no way I could lift it up and carry it, so I had to drag it with one arm over my shoulder.
They had to drag it with one arm over their shoulder. He walked slowly, step by step, as if he was pressing down on the ground.

Tiket was not going to eat. The altar room found on this floor is the place to bring the altar.

If she had not been a priest and worked in another profession, she would have been able to pass it by and pretend not to see it. Otherwise, he would have had to go to the Loafers, the Chaotic Gods, or the same Nyusyutic Gods.

From the style of the altar, it was immediately obvious to Tique that it was a Krom altar.
No, he could see it. Yes, he could see it. He had seen it day after day, year after year.
He couldn't be wrong. There was no way he could be wrong.

Tzike cleaned the ruined altar and asked for an offering for Krom.
The woman said, "I'm going to give you something to offer to Krom.

The funny thing is, the same floor is where the Jiants live. I had already seen that
By now, Tiké's strength had increased to the point where she was able to easily beat Jianto. Back on earth, he would be a Canon.
He would even be awarded the title of Canon if he ever returned to the ground. The armor I am wearing at the moment is the same as the one I had on the last time I was here.
The armor she wears now is a scale armor made from the scales of a Grey Dragoshi she defeated a while ago,
The sword, for example, belonged to the Excalibur.

When the petrified poison of Cockatrice had poisoned his body, and he had called out to Krom just before he lost consciousness.
When he called out to Kromm just before he was rendered unconscious by the petroleum poison from Cockatrice. When he was surrounded by minophthaurs and was restored to health by Krom's power.

Other times, it was to remove a cursed ring, or for some other random reason.

Teeke regained his composure and started to move his legs again.

Offerings, Prayers

A few minutes passed, and Teeke was between the altars. The body of the gyan t was left in the altar room.
Makoto Yokooka turned back to the sheet of paper as it was, and the forgiveness was too much, and it was as rough as a dead horse.
He was breathing heavily, like a dying horse. After resting for a few minutes, he finally got up.
After a few minutes of rest, he finally got up and began to mumble a few words of prayer, as if he had been too lazy to do so.

The bigger the monster, the greater the payback. The Boiling God will calm his anger.
And if you have an amicable relationship with him, he may give you a powerful item of advice.

Nevertheless, he had become accustomed to exploring the maze.
There were some horribly disfigured monsters who had become quite accustomed to exploring the maze, but they did not seem to know the identity of their instigators.
There were no gruesome monsters, no nasty traps that revealed the character of the instigators.

There was a fountain in the room. The screams in this case could be called `squeals of joy' or `shrieks of delight'.
The scream in this case is called `the scream of joy.
`Cry, cry, cry!

The Teeke, who is so jubilant as he approaches the fountain, has completely forgotten to warn his surroundings.
He is oblivious to his surroundings.

The depression in the floor must be a pool of water seeping from the well. It must have been knee-deep.
It is deep enough to kneel in. Teeke kneeled on the floor and looked into the water. The clear water was like a mirror.
The clear water reflects her face like a mirror.

As a result, Teeke's entire body was too dirty to be seen in public as a teenage girl.

Finally, she found a fountain where she could bathe. There were three more fountains on the upper floors.
(iii) There was another spring three floors up, but it was filled with dead orcs floating in the water, and it smelled terrible.

A chainmail dropped to the floor and fell to the ground.

With one hand still covering her still-uncleared breasts, Teeke tried to get into the fountain from the sun's tip.

As soon as her feet touch the water, she screams and decides to enter the spring.
She wanted to go to the fountain. The desire to bathe in the water was so strong that she forgot another important thing.

Going down the stairs would naturally slow down.

(How pathetic!)

I think about Lou's lips (8).
(I wonder what he would say if he saw me like this.)

Nasrullah was thinking of the faces of his friends at the orphanage.

Nasrullah shouts at me as I fearlessly descend the stairs.

It was a classmate, Liiifor. He was looking down at Nasrullah from the climbing stairs.

I don't think so.

Nasrullah checks his projection and steps out slowly.
I'm not going to do it again. I'm totally done. Move, I'll show you how it's done.
I don't mind. I'm doing as I please. You had a problem, didn't you?
You once had a task, didn't you? You had an assignment for me, didn't you? Did you do that one?

Liffey's color changed. Her mouth twisted and her tongue wagged.

Nasrullah thought. I've won....
(I've won.)

And then she saw that she had won. As she had expected, Liffey had disappeared over her head.

(I'm not joking. If I had to train with a man like that .....)

Nasrullah knew very well that he would only end up in self-defeat. In less than half the time

Nasrullah knew what was said about the bandits outside the orphanage. She is proud of her profession as a thief, and she is proud to be associated with the students who are with her.
Few of the students had any contact with him. One of the few exceptions was Nasrullah.

Nasrullah and Liffor had a special bond. The skills he taught me were countless.
I have no idea how many techniques he taught me. He taught me how to open the box, how to remove the green, and most of my manual skills.

When the exercise was over, the man called out to her without fail. He would then give her his next advice.
The next time the man asked her for help, she was given the following advice: "I'm sorry, I can't help you.

Nasrullah had the feeling that he could hear the man's voice again.
B U7,

Going down the stairs or climbing up the stairs is a necessary action to conquer the cave.
It is a necessary action to control the grotto.

To use the stairs, you must first find them. Normally, stairs are located in the dungeon.
Stairs are usually marked with a < and a > in the dashboard. If the symbol is not visible
If you cannot see the sign, try walking around the statue. It may be hidden under the statue.
%, %, %, %, %, %, %, %, %, %, %, %, %, %.

To ascend or descend, move the cara over each symbol and press the same key as the symbol.
The group will turn off immediately afterwards. Immediately after, the display switches and you can see that you are at the upper or lower level.
You should be able to confirm that you are at the upper or lower level.

But if you have too much netherworld, you'll find yourself on the wrong side of the stairs, and you'll end up in the swamp, or even the bottom level.
It is not always possible to use the stairs. When using stairs, you must also pay attention to the system and its carrying capacity.
The use of stairs also requires attention to the system and carrying capacity. Also, if you use the stairs to go up from level 1 without the Yearender's charms, you will be forced to use the Gebänder's charms, and you will be forced to use the Gebänder's charms.
Using the stairs without the ejender's amulet will end the game, so make sure you do everything correctly.
Do not make any mistakes.

As the armor progresses, there will be other ways to move from one level to another. However, the basic rule is to use the stairs.
The basic idea is to use the stairs, and it is impossible to achieve the goal without using the stairs.
It is impossible to achieve the goal without using the stairs. When we reach a new floor, we should first make sure there is a staircase to the bottom.

She removed her platemail and found a new stirrup in front of her. The color was a light gray.
It was not a good impression. It was made entirely of leather, with no metal.
v, If it were in a specialty store, no one would ever think of buying it.

It is unlikely that anyone would buy it even if it were in a specialty store. They were unappealing stirrups.
But she knew. She knew that they were the stirrups of the dragon. It was a very good stirrup, better than all other stirrups.
It was a strong hoe, stronger and more defensive than all other stirrups.

Do you know what a dragon's bell is?

The uncle spoke of a medical bell that was used by Dunsintho.

At that time, Nasrullah was returning home with his aunt and her husband. It was a risky departure.
She had already informed him in a letter that she was going to go on a trip. However, he had not told Danjon that he would be leaving for an emergency.
However, he had told her that he would be leaving for a dangerous trip, and that was the reason why she was so afraid.

It is different from marrying a bride. It is more likely that I will not see her for a long time.

Nasrullah listened to his uncle's words in silence.

But you still want to go, don't you?
Chisrulla nodded.
But you want to go, don't you? I'm going to tell you one more thing, and you'll listen to it as if it were a promise.]
Then he asked Nasrullah if he knew the Dragon's armor.

Nasrullah shook his head. It was something they didn't teach us at the orphanage.

The bell is the cupola made of dragon scales. The bell is made of dragon scales.
It is much harder than those bells. It is much harder than the bells made from the scales of dragons.
They are the strongest. It's the strongest of all.

I didn't know that.

The talk of "I wanted to be the best.

They didn't teach me that at the training school.

I guess you're right. Few people have ever seen the Dragon's stirrups. In the old days, the prophet king, Bai'ari, was the king of the ring.
From Baiali and Godolphin, the Ring King, to Sir Eclipses and Sir St. Simon,
There are only a few, including Sir Eclipses, Sir St. Simon, and Sir William Hyperion.

Then why does my uncle know?

"Surely, my uncle knows too. ...... FAN=ZERRE RO, `Well, my uncle knows.

"It was a long time ago."

He waved his hand.

More important are the dragon's stirrups. Listen to me, okay? The stirrups of a dragon are the stirrups of a dead dragon.
The stirrups are made from dead dragons. If you are lucky enough to defeat a dragon, you will be able to use the stirrups to make the dragon's stirrups.

Nasrullah listened to his uncle. He was very careful to explain every detail.
When Nasrullah finished listening, he told her about his uncle. When he finished, she had not a single question to ask him.

I was like, "Okay, you got it. Now I should be able to make stirrups. Chance.
If you think it's a chance, don't hesitate to try it. Good.

Nasrullah had one thing on his mind.

Nasrullah looked at the stirrups and thought.

( Thank you, Uncle! I have the best armor.)

She took the stirrups in her hand. It was lighter than the platemail. I have just poked her in the breastplate with my sword.
I tried to pierce her breastplate with my sword just now, but I could not get a scratch. She was a good defender, no doubt.
She took her eyes off the stirrup in front of her. She replaced her sword with a sturmbringer and stepped down to the stairs.

I am sure it will protect your daughter better than the stirrups that are already enchanted. I can see it clearly.
I don't see it.
That's right, my age is different from your daughter's. I'm not the same age as your daughter. If you can see it, I can see it.
If she could see that, I would give up the store to her and retire immediately. Other people can't see what other people can't see.

They are useless. I had no intention of buying useless stirrups.

The clerk hit him on the chest. A dry sound filled the store.
These stirrups are really nice. You'll see. You'll see.

The only way to survive and fight them was to stay put.

Nasrullah held the stirrup tightly and placed it on the ground.

(11) The Decree of Renunciation
The ground of the cave is strewn with fresh blood.
Breathing heavily, Klein pulls the short sword from the goblin's body and pulls the goblin out of the cave.

He pulled the short sod from Goblin's body. The dead goblin loses his support and falls to the floor.

Klein's right shoulder was now in his hand, and he was able to pull it away from him.
Klein puts his hand on his right shoulder and sees that he has passed through a torn leather armour and is alive.

Throwing it.

Warm blood was flowing.

I'm sure Mike's guy is worried about me falling in the pit, so we'll get back to it and get the wound healed as soon as possible.
I'll turn back and get my wounds healed. ......

Just as Klein was thinking this, a male cry that reminded him of a monster bird echoed through the darkened dry cave.
The moment Klein thought of this, a scream echoed through the darkened dry cave.

With squinted eyes, he spots the enemy, and unintentionally, a word of divine abuse escapes from his mouth.

Dark green scales covered his body and amber eyes that showed no emotion,
The dark-green scales covering his body, the amber eyes that never show emotion, and the broad jaws full of spiked fangs make him the perfect lizardman.

Hastily changing his weapon to a bow, Klein fired an arrow at the approaching lizardman.
He shot an arrow at the approaching Lizard Man. Two of the four arrows hit Lizard Man, but did not inflict a fatal wound.
The second of the four arrows brushed against Lizardman's body, but did not inflict a fatal wound. Meanwhile, Lizardman used his sword to defend his head.
He continued to close the distance between him and Clayne.

Cline's toes seemed to be shifting.
(9) The patient's toes are not as close as they should be.

After throwing the bow, Cline threw the short sod toward the leatherman.
I threw the short sod toward the leather man.

The sordo ripped open the window and flew in a straight line past Lizardman's head.
But when Lizardman thrust his sword forward again, it was easily repelled.

He had to escape, and it would have been a fool's choice to let the battle rage on. ...... (3)

A few moments of hesitation allowed Leatherman to approach. The wailing man was convinced of his victory.
With a cry of wailing joy, he charged forward with his sword in his hands, confident of victory. He was expecting the taste of Klein's meat.
The bubbling saliva is constantly flowing from Leatherman's mouth as he anticipates the taste of Krahn's meat.
Lizardman's mouth was constantly frothing with saliva as he anticipated the taste of the chicken meat.

There must be something he can do. Something ........

Klein kept his line of sight on the leather man and reached into the sack with one hand.
Klein kept his line of sight on the leather man and sipped the contents of the sack with one hand. Various items of information were felt through his sweaty palms.

When Leatherman was only a few steps away, Klein's hand came into contact with a cold gas bottle.

Lizardman screams in terror, and lowers his sword in the opposite direction from where Klein is.
R7wl Lizardman yelps and unsheathes his sword in the opposite direction from where Klein is.

He turns away from Lizardman, who is swinging his sword like a madman, and Clayne heads for the upper aisle.
The two men were comfortable with each other.

Behind them, there is an angry growl as they try to elude their prey.

Heh, geez!

With a wicked grin, Klein steps into the aisle.

Whenever he used his flying apparatus on the netback, whenever he threw his items, and whenever he used the netback, he would throw his items.
When using the net-back, when using the flying gear, and when feeding the pets (8)

When you use the "dohmi" (see below), people will not be able to use the bow for the first time.
The person who is to use a bow must prepare the bow with the w command, point the arrow with the t command, and then point in the direction of the arrow.
The bow must be loaded, of course, and the direction must be indicated. Of course, it is possible to throw an arrow without a bow, but the arrow must be thrown with the hand.
However, the force of a hand shot is less than that of a shot with a bow.

Next, you can throw your handhelds, but most items are not worth throwing.

With a clear sound of steel breaking, the needle of the darts inserted in the keyhole of the treasure chest popped off.
The needle flew out of the lock of the treasure chest.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Tiket threw the missing darts into the floor of the room and sat down on the floor.
He sat down on the floor. Trying to imitate the thief, he tried to pick the lock, but this did not work.
But this was not going to work. I broke the first darts I had broken, and now I had to break the fifth one.
I had broken the last dart, and this was the fifth one.

T iket looked at the pentagonal keyhole with resentment. If only I had a key that fits this keyhole,

But Teeke only had a triangular key and a square key.
The key is a triangular key and a rectangular key. Why do you have to keep the key?

Michael, who was walking around the room, turned to Tiket and squealed, "Meow!
The first time she saw him, she thought she was being called. He must have thought he was being called.

Now Tiket has two choices.

Either he would finish the treasure chest and leave, or he would play the role of a bandit until the key was unlocked.
You can either leave the treasure chest alone or play the role of a thief until it is unlocked. Another option is to walk away with the treasure chest until you find the pentagonal key.
Another option is to walk around with a treasure chest until you find a pentagonal key, but this is out of the question.

Tietje decided to engage in full-scale combat.

She took off the braid that was holding her bangs up and held it in her right hand. This gold diadem was to be used to enter the cave.
This gold hair ornament was a gift from a male child the day before she entered the cave. You will have to try to fold the sixth one.
(6) I know I can't unlock the door with my darts, even if I don't try to break the second one. We need something softer, like a wire.
I need something like a softer wire.
Sorry, Mr. Fillian.

Tiket inserted the soft wire into the keyhole.

After a few moments, she finally gave up. The pure gold pin of the hair ornament in her hand was nothing.
The pure gold pin in her hand was bent and no longer served its intended purpose.

The talker's bird's-eye view of the station, the l-stripping of the bird's tail, and the removal of the bird's tail from its body.

Tchaiké threw the treasure chest to the wind. The sound of thumping, indicating the presence of the objects inside, was heard.
The thumping sound that indicated the presence of the objects inside was annoying. Michael, who had fallen asleep beside Teeke, woke up.
Mykel, who had been sleeping beside Teeke, woke up and mewed, "Meow!

COMMANDS To walk through the cave...

Kicking the monster will give you a damage. Samurai and Priest's `kicks' are particularly powerful.
The `"kick"' of Samurai and Priest in particular is so powerful that they can take down shallow monsters with a single blow.

Normal doors can be opened with the o-command, but locked doors can only be opened with a duplicate key or a keypad.
To open a locked door, you have to use a duplicate key, a credit card, or kick it open at random.
There is no way to open the door. However, once a door has been kicked in, it cannot be closed again.
Therefore, if you plan to use the door in the future, such as when you need to use the dormitory, it is better not to use the door.
If you plan to use the door in the future, such as when you need a dormitory, it would be wise to stop using it. Also, kicking the loam will only hurt your feet.
If the door is a concealed door, you can kick through it just as easily as you can through a visible door.
If it is a concealed door, you can kick through it just as easily as you can through a visible door.

When the item is kicked, the item moves in the direction of the kick in the case of a Taitai.
However, the point of the kick is not a point of attack. However, it is better not to kick the point, as it may be broken by the impact.
It is better not to do this. The distance the item moves depends on its weight and gut force (too heavy and too weak).
(If the item is too heavy, it will not move.) And let's not forget,
Kicking the treasure chest can break the lock. However, the trap is not a trap.
If a trap has been planted, be sure to make sure that it works.

There's no end to this! Oh, God! Oh, God!

Teeke swung his sword at the ogre in front of him with a wicked grin on his face. Excerpt
The river cuts off the torso of the ogre very gently, and the upper part of the ogre's body falls backwards with a clean slice.
The upper half of his body falls behind him, revealing a sharp cut. As if overcoming the corpse, the next monstrosity quickly moves in front of it.
The next monster came forward. This time it was a demon with a burning flame on its body.
It was

The area around Teeke was filled with the corpses of the Monsters. How many have you seen so far?
Tiké herself doesn't even know how many she's lost.

Fear Liu

Teeke receives a dragon blaze from a long distance away in the shield. Bull.
The dragons' "electric breath" was reflected back onto the mirrored surface of the shield, and several mobiles were seen in the distance.

Pry open, see what's inside.

The star is then wrapped around the wall and disappears into a corner of the room.

Electricity, fire, and magic of all kinds were of no use to Teeke.
The qualities he had acquired in the course of his wanderings through the cave, or the weapons he had acquired, rendered the light and magic of the indirect attacks ineffective.
The most powerful hoe was the one that could be used to cut down the enemy's armor. And the most powerful hoe, the Skylmaei, is protected by the scales of the Glade Dragon.
The skeil mail, protected by the scales of the most powerful hoe, protected Teeke from almost all attacks.

The dragon withstood several slashes, but finally fell. Then, the other monsters began to attack.
It did not take long for the other monsters to suffer the same fate. ......

I think that's it... o Is this the last of them? Is this the last one?

Tiket throws the treasure chest on the floor. One after another, treasure chests and long chests were found, and Teeke was stunned to find that the treasure chests and long chests were all in the same place.
In a sort of amazement, she gathered all of them in one place.

In all, there were about 8 (eight) pieces. It was the first time Teeke had ever found so many treasure chests in one room.
It was the first time for Teeke to find so many treasure chests in one room. On the upper floor was the castle, where she found armories and treasuries, but she had never seen so many treasure chests in one room.
On the upper floor, there was a castle with an armory and a treasure room, but there were no treasure chests there, just the items arranged as they were in the room.
There is no treasure chest.

Teeke was bitten in front of the pile of treasure chests. Experientially, it is a good idea to keep a good eye on what is in the treasure chest.
He knew from experience that what was in the treasure chest was a good item.

He inserted the excalibur between the lids and used all his weight to pry the hoard open.
This was a very difficult task for Teeke, who had to use all his strength to pry it open. This was unusual for Teeke. I usually kick open treasure chests.
But he had to kick open the treasure chest. It would have been easier to pry it open with a sword or something with a sharp point, but he didn't want to use the holy sword for this.
But I don't feel comfortable using the holy sword for such a purpose.
Even I got tired of it. ...... J

I thought that since it was the Holy Sword of legend, it would not break or fall off.
Thinking casually that since it was a sacred sword of legend, it would not break or fall off, Teeke began to work on the next long chest. In no time at all, all the lids were opened.
In no time at all, all the lids were opened.

There were a number of strong options, including the Treecheat Opus Passu, the Lincoln Knot dockyard, and the Ndjimoneua Mimomão Ring, but in the end Teeke chose the Scroll.
In the end, Teeke chose only a few scrolls.

There is also a way to open the treasure chest by kicking it with the k-command. You can also use the k-command to kick the treasure chest and break it open, or you can use the k-command to sleep (see Fig. 8).
The treasure box can also be "used" by the command (8), but it is not recommended to use it to remove the heavy treasure box.

Nasrullah is only super hungry.

It has been a long time since she lost her last meal. It is a long way to the grocery store. First of all, we had no money.
We searched for food on this floor, but there was no food to be found. We had to search for water and water supplies.
We could find some water, but there was no way we could stomach it.

They needed food, especially meat. They needed meat.

If I didn't, I would get dizzy and collapse.
I need to ask for help. Please, anything you want, just come out.

Holding her stomach, the woman saw a door in front of her as she tried to get out of the cave.

Her anticipation is high. It is a common occurrence that a monster appears just after opening the door of a room.
It's a story. In one case, the monster attacked him and he was seriously injured. If you get it right, you can get two of them.
There may be two or three of them if things go well. No, as long as they abused their hunger, any number of them would do.
If they abused their hunger, any number of them would have been fine. I could use all kinds of magic and items to defeat the demons.
I was loyal to him.

Nasrullah leaned against the door. Nasrullah takes a deep breath and opens the door.

The house was not very spacious. Instinctively she looked around the room and saw no sign of the monster.
She could not see the monster.

For a moment, it seemed as if her expectations had been betrayed.

(Is that a joke?)

I feel weak and weak all over my body.

However, when she hears a growling voice coming from the back of the room, her expression brightens.
Her face lightened up. She saw something in front of Nasrullah's history, at a point far away from her.
She saw something. There it was. It was Jhakkar. Red eyes shining, copper fangs bared, he was intimidating her.
It was a jackal, red eyes shining, copper fangs bared, threatening the woman.

Nasrullah cheered.
`It's so bubby!

Nasrullah leapt at him faster than Jhakkar could attack him.
He swung his sword with all his strength and tried to duck, but was turned to the right. He was so hungry that he could not exert himself.
He was hungry, and his body was not strong enough. In any other situation, his neck and torso would have been cut in two without a doubt.

Jhakkar was on him faster than Nasrullah could draw his sword. Kajkar's sword was in the air, but he had to fight his way out of it.
The sword, which he had barely managed to claw out, blocked his fangs in front of him. Fangs and sword clashed, and Jhakkar's foul-smelling breath was heard on the ground as he swiped at the eggplant.
Jacquel's foul-smelling breath poked Nasrullah in the nose.

Nasrullah backed away and swung his sword, but only scratched his ear.
B

Nasrullah continues to attack, but not as fast as he would like. On the contrary, Jhakal's claws and fangs were chasing him.
The claws and fangs of Jhakkar were chasing him down. Jerkal is not the kind of opponent that I would normally take the time to deal with, but now he is just too slow.
But now it was too late. I couldn't put strength into my arm to wield the sword, and it was difficult to hit the target itself.
I was not able to do it.
(If I don't do this, I will be eaten before I can eat meat.)

(3) He had to make a last-ditch counterattack before he ran out of energy, so he decided to go for the slingshot.
He decides to stick out the tip and bend over.
Come on!]

Nasrullah's spirit is up, and at the same time, Jhakkar leaps forward. Nasrullah is not going to let him get away.
Nasrullah has no intention of escaping. Nasrullah is not about to let Nasrullah get away. He catches Jhakkar's fangs from above and stops his opponent.
Nasrullah was not about to let Nasrullah get away. JACKAL continues to push, but Nasrullah does not back down. JACKAL retreated backward.
(2) Nasrullah cannot pull back.

The passion she puts into her flesh is unbelievable. She exerts as much physical strength as she can,
She pushes the jackal that is far stronger than she is.

Jacquel, feeling disadvantaged, should keep his distance from Nasrullah, who will follow him.
(8) "Ah!

Nasrullah took advantage of the moment and unsheathed his sword. Nasrullah was just about to retreat.
Nasrullah could not even dodge the jakkar because he had just retreated. A killing blow struck him in the skull.
The brain was torn apart. The brain entanglements flew off and the eyeballs fell out.

Teeke bent down and gently picked up the ring.

The rings are now in place.
Hah! Hah!

The owner's voice startles Teeke, and he almost drops his ring.

The owner's voice startles her, and she almost drops the ring.

The shopkeeper, who had been polishing his shields at the end of the store, pauses and looks at Teeke from behind a round-rimmed ophthalmoscope.
The shopkeeper, who was polishing his shields at the end of the shop, stopped and looked at Teeke from behind a round-rimmed ophthalmoscope. The owner's expression was "Would you like to buy it? "Would you like to buy it?
The owner's expression was a silent question, "Would you like to buy it?

I am a good friend.

Teeke smiled shyly. The beauty of the ring made me reach for it.
I felt ashamed of myself for reaching for it because of the beauty of the rings. I had no idea what effect it would have.
I had no idea what effect it would have.

I don't even know what the benefits are. I am ashamed of myself for having done this, and I don't even know what effect it will have.]
I'm not sure I understand. I'm not interested in that. What is important is how long it will last.
The important thing is how long it lasts.

As the shopkeeper was about to go back to his work, Teeke hurriedly asked him, "What is it?
Teeke asked the shopkeeper, who was about to go back to his work, in a panic. I don't know what it is, so how can I get a price for it?
That's a merchant's intuition. There is no doubt that the ring is a bargain.
There is no doubt about it. You can put up a signboard in this store.

Teeke sighs. This store is selling something unknown at a price.
The shop is selling something for an unknown price. It seems that the only thing they can rely on is their own eyes.

After returning the ring to its place, Teeke walked around the store looking for food, healing potions, and other items to sell.
He walked around the store, looking for food, healing potions, magic, and even a little rice cake.
We only collected items that had been proven to work. However, only in the case of the spelling book, I had never seen it before.

As in the real world, when you buy something, you have to pay for it.
However, in the real world, when you buy something, you have to pay for it, and so there is a unique "SP-S Oatsu 9" em uma n.
This is the reason why NetHack is NetHack.

The question of whether or not to pay the price to the shopkeeper is a question of whether or not to pay the price to the shopkeeper. The "mazure" is the view of the mazure. The shop is being viewed as a good thing by the makers of the product, but it is also a good thing that the shop is not paying for the goods.
However, if the customer leaves the store without paying the bill, he or she will have to deal with a troublesome situation.

If you intend to pay, just type in (5) after picking up the item.
If you enter (5) after picking up an item, the price of all items will be automatically paid from your money. If you don't have enough money in your pocket, enter (5).
If you don't have enough money, sell the unwanted items by dropping them on the floor with the d command.
If you have enough money, you can sell the unneeded equipment by dropping it on the floor with a d-command.
In addition, most of the W's are not interested in buying other IT systems.
Most of the treasure troves are not available for purchase. Most stores will buy back Treasure Stone, but it is a lost cause.
Most shops will buy the treasure from you, but most of the treasure you pick up in the maze is worth 0 "glass balls".
It is better to remember the following two points. However, some genuine gems can be bought for extremely high prices.
However, some genuine gems can be bought for very high prices, and certain uses will gain favor with the gods.
In this sense, it is a very important thing. In this sense, the ability of archaeologists to identify gemstones is extremely useful.
(2) However, it is not always easy to find the right stones.

As a matter of fact, there have been many adventurers in this world since ancient times who have tried to find out how to make a store look like a store.
How do they cheat the snowy eyes and get their hands on it without a paycheck? | How can I get it without pay?)
I don't know how to do this. Here are just a few tips on some of the methods. The first one is the pet & kick (8), which depends on the pet & kick (9).
The first method is to use a kick ⑧ to cross a morse, and the second method is to use a ported (or ported) medical doctor.
The first is "4) of 4).

The wounds were also deep. Blood began to spurt from Notaurus' claw marks.
The bandages had to be removed and reattached several times. No matter how many times the bandages were changed, they were still stained red.

(If only I had a cleave at this point...)

The wound, though deep, would soon heal. But the street and the medicine had already been used.
He had already used all his supplies and medicines.

I wanted to take a rest in a small room with the door locked, but the wound was too deep. If they met a monster, it would be the last thing they would ever do. Now we have to wait.
The first is (4) and the second is (5).

Nasrullah was almost breathless.

(You've been adventuring for a long time, haven't you?)

Nasrullah did not know when he had entered the cave.
A week, a month, two months? It was only recently that Nasrullah had been able to break through her aunt's tearful restraint.
It seems like it was a year ago that I ignored my friend's wishes.
I feel as if it has been a year since I ignored my friend's wish.

I was so anxious when I passed through the gate of the cave.
There are monsters over 5 meters tall.

[The creature is said to kill all who approach it with its dragon's breath.

The beak made her feel uneasy and confused.

Nasrullah's desire to avenge her parents was stronger than her anxiety.
Nasrullah's desire to avenge his parents was stronger than his anxiety.

Nasrullah's father was killed by a monster dozens of floors below the cave. When Nasrullah's mother and father learned of this, they too fell asleep in the shack.
When Nasrullah's mother and father found out, they too fell asleep in the shack and died soon afterwards. Nath, left alone in the house
Nasrullah was taken in by his aunt and uncle, who had no children.

Her aunt's husband was a craftsman who made tools for farming. He had the stubbornness of a craftsman.
He was stubborn as a craftsman, but he was kind to Nasrullah. No matter how bad her mood was, he never laid a hand on her.
No matter how bad her mood was, he never laid a hand on her. When he scolded her, he would only speak up a little, but never yelled at her.
He never yelled at her. When she cried, he always gave her a hug. Nasrullah was a very strong man.
Nasrullah loved her uncle's iron-encrusted chest.

Her aunt was very strict with her strict uncle. She was especially harsh in her discipline.
She was especially harsh in her discipline, and if there was even the slightest misbehavior in the way she stood, she would yell at him without hesitation.
If he was too lazy to stand up for himself, he would yell at him. More than once, he beat her up. He would help her with her chores.
She would go to the house to help him with his chores, and if he went out to play, she would let him in when he came home.
He was allowed to stay at home, even though he had to skip dinner, because his uncle would not let him.

Only once did he spend the night in an outhouse. I have only once spent the night in a storage room.

Resting

It was when I visited the town where Sroula lived. She lied to her aunt and went to listen to the stories of the gastropods.
She lied to her aunt and went to listen to the stories of the gastropods. The story was so pleasant that she could not bring herself to go home.
When I returned home, it was already dark. Nasrullah asked her to let him in.
Nasrullah asked her to let him in, but his aunt would not open the door.

Makoto, I'm going to the door now. I don't know where you're going right now.

I guess it's the place of the infidels. I know exactly what I'm talking about.

Aunt, listen to me.

I don't want to listen to a girl who can't listen to me. I'm not going to listen to a girl who won't listen to me.
Cool your head.

Nasrullah knocked on the door several times, but there was no response. She was crying.
She went to the storage room. It was spring, but the mornings and evenings were cold. Shivering, she continued to walk.

108 COMMANDS 1. To walk through the cave ......

He spent the rest of the night without even trying.

My aunt's habit was to "be a woman," and she was very strict in her education.

Nasrullah, however, did not resent her aunt's policy. She was more than willing to help Nasrullah to learn to be a better mother.
She probably knew that Nasrullah was strongly influenced by her father's blood.
She must have been aware that Nasrullah's father's blood was strong in her, so she made sure he was educated as a woman. She did not want to follow in her father's footsteps.
She must have wanted to be an ordinary woman so that she would not repeat her father's example. I understood my aunt's concern for her children.
I could understand her concern for my aunt's welfare. When I spent the night in the storage room, I found a blanket and a nightly meal placed on the floor. I knew that my aunt hated me.
I knew that my aunt did not hate me.
Nasrullah would have liked to live with his aunt and uncle if he could have. However, she could not.
But the adventurous spirit she had inherited from her high-fire father and mother could not help but cause her to be adventurous.
She could not help it.

When Nasrullah reached the age of ⑯, he told his foster father that he was going to take Gil e BA to train a gastroenterologist.
She told her foster father and others that she was going to be a mother. Of course, his aunt and uncle objected. They wanted Nasrullah to marry their son-in-law.
They wanted Nasrullah to be their son-in-law and to take over the family business. They wanted Nasrullah to be their son-in-law and to take over the family business.
He repeatedly asked Nasrullah to lead a life of love and care for him and his children.

However, Nasrullah would not give up.

It might be dangerous. It could be dangerous, it could be reckless.

But the waiting woman couldn't help but go.

Nasrullah had joined Gildo three years before, overcoming the opposition of his superiors.
This was three years earlier.

The father of the guru's son.

Jacquard's growl brought her back to reality. Fangs and red eyes are pointed at her.
It was intimidation. It was intimidation. It would attack her at any moment.

Nasrullah stood up. The time of emotion was over.

As she was about to open the door, she was startled by a strange sensation and reached for the knob.
He felt a strange sensation and unexpectedly pulled back his hand on the knob.

Through the door, she could feel a certain atmosphere.

It was somehow similar to the atmosphere he had felt at the temple where he was born and raised.
It is somehow similar to what Teeke felt in the temple chapel where he was born and raised. Priests generally have a strong sense of spiritual presence.
The purpose of the practice is to connect to God and to the spiritual presence. This is natural, since the purpose of their practice is to communicate with God.

Tziké closed his eyes and tried to perceive the presence with a clear mind.

(Oh, I've done it!)

This presence was not a higher being, like God. It was something cloudy.
It is a cloudy feeling. I thought there might be an "altar room" on the other side of the door, but I was afraid there would be no Doma &.
There is something about the altar room that is not quite as welcoming as it seems. Tique holds the mace on her waist in her right hand,
He readjusted the shield in his left hand.

He thrusts in through the shoulder and opens the door.

They were trying to get close to her with unsteady steps. It was not nice to be led by a group of people, let alone a single body.

Täike couldn't stop his will to fight from fading away so quickly. It's not worth it.
Even though she knew it was wrong, it was a woman's nature to have difficulty with this kind of opponent.
I couldn't do anything about it.

It was the end of the line.

In a few seconds she would have screamed and run away.

The only thing we can rely on is our own strength to get to the next level.
It is only our own strength that we can rely on. !
Teeke shouted as she attacked Mommy.

Teeke soon realized that her inexperience had caused Anded's turn to fail.
But that's another story.

Tugendered is a special skill that only Freist and Kajot possess. A spell with the same name can be found in many places in the world.
Although there are spells with the same name, they have the same effect and can destroy an android's android.
The spell can be used to destroy an android's android. However, the spells can only be used a limited number of times, but the two classes listed above can be used a limited number of times.
The difference is that the two classes above have an innate ability to be used an unlimited number of times.
The two classes differ in that they have an innate ability and can be used as many times as they wish without limit. The Wanyo Pastet Koominck-Kut and the Wanyo Pastet Koominck-Kut are the most common.
The only purpose of the "K" is to scare the anded into running away, which is not the same as a power or a spell.
It is different from powers and spells.

The effects of the taunts are only effective on visible and dead bodies. If they are inside the room, they will not be able to see it.
If they are inside a house, all of the respondents are targeted, but if they are in a passageway where they can only see one step ahead, they can only see their neighbors.
(1) If you are in a passageway where you can only see up to one step ahead, you can only see adjacent addresses. However, in a walkway where you can only see up to 1 step ahead, only the adjacent anddesides will be targeted.
The answer that is known by the telepathic ability is not actually seen by the eyes, so it is not effective.
Therefore, they are not effective. Similarly, if the eyes are at a discount, they cannot be turned.
It is not possible.

The success of a successful turn to break the anddeed is dependent on the success of the turn.
The distance between Makuku's empirire and R-Ku's gunjore is a few levels less than the distance between Makuku's empirire and R-Ku's gunjore.
Against the andedges, Tern almost always succeeds. The higher andeds are not tolerated by Tern.
The higher the level difference, the more the success rate decreases.
The success rate decreases as the gap between the two levels widens.

However, if a turn is successful, no experience value is gained, and the number of successful turns is limited by the number of times a turn can be broken.
Only one body can be destroyed in a single turn, and the only ones who can turn are those who are more likely to be able to turn than themselves.
The only ones that can turn are the ones that can be broken in a few more turns than themselves, and the ones that can turn reliably are the ones that are at level T and the ones that can be broken in a few more turns than themselves.
It may be better to leave the country and go to Europe. The blessed weapon is an undecided weapon.
If you have a blessed weapon, you can use it to protect yourself and your family.
If you have a blessed weapon, you should choose the offensive without hesitation.

112 COMMANDS 1 1 1 To walk in a cave ...

I don't like the idea of being a bandit.

The screams of the fourteen year olds were leading them into a devil's cave.

Downstairs, Jositne had found a long chest.

Not an uncommon occurrence. On some floors, there are three or four chests or treasure chests.
The long chests were sometimes found on the first floor. The lock on the long chest was a square lock that required a key.
He did not have a key. So, he tried to kick it open as if it were a square.
He tried to kick it open, but this time he felt something on the edge. Hostility.
I could feel a hostility or what I would call a murderous intent from Changitsu.

It was precisely because he had this sense that he had been able to survive as an adventurer all this time.
It was this sense that had enabled him to survive as an adventurer. Yoshitane knew very well that this sense could not be ignored.
Yoshitane knew that this sensation could not be ignored, but he was not a thief by profession.

Jositne had received a course of instruction from Gildo. But only a defeat.
He was only given a grade. He did receive a grade. But the instructor told Yoshitsune that if he actually found the trap, he would not dismantle it.
He told Yoshitsune, "If you actually find a trap, don't think of dismantling it.

He was dexterous, after all.

No, "dexterous" might not be the right word for (3) Sitzneh. He was very dexterous.
He was quite dexterous. However, the task of dismantling the animals itself was not suited to his nature.
It was not in his nature.

For the past two moments, Yoshitsune had been sitting in front of the long chest, waiting to be set up.
(1) He was looking for the type of stay that might have been planted in the long chest.
(2) "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Yoshikine lay down on the floor. Without a doubt, Tou would be the one to do the trick.
I could only understand that Tou must have been planted. On the other hand, it took me a few moments to understand that the tao had been planted.
This only proved that Saatchi's senses were correct.

One way was to ignore the fact that the two were not in agreement and to kick them over. It is true that the parents would have acted.
The parents would act, but only what was inside could be accessed. However, if the animal burst into flames, it would be impossible to get to it.
But if the animal was going to burst into flames, it might as well be sleeping gas or a paralyzing poison needle.

Electricity, electrolysis, and electrolytic dissolution.

The possibility of being devoured by goblins and orcs while sleeping was enough to make me want to go to bed. The possibility of being gobbled up by goblins and orcs while we slept was a real possibility.
It's a possibility.

There were so many possibilities running through Josine's mind that they all went to the trash can in the corner of her mind.
All of them were tossed into the trash can in the corner of his mind.

I knew I was left with the simplest of choices. Even after all this time, I was still able to make the right choice.
It was a bit of a surprise to me that I had to make this choice after all the time I had spent on it.
But as long as there was nothing else left to do, there was nothing I could do.
I'll just have to finish up."

With a groan and a sigh, Josine stood up unsteadily.
Ursula, who had been curled up on the other side of the tree, noticed his presence and said, "Come on!
The urushi, which had been curled up in a ball across from the tree, noticed the presence and stood up with a yawn, as if to say, "Come on!

Obtaining the famous sword and stirrups was important, but surviving was more important than anything else.
But Yoshitane also knew that survival was more important than anything else. However, he could not make up his mind.
I felt ashamed of myself for wasting so much time without making a decision.

Later, Josine went on a teleportation trip and saw two more trees in front of this long tree.

He would come to me once in a while. It is a different story when he finds out that there is nothing inside, even though he has accidentally succeeded in dismantling the displacement.
It is another story to know that there is nothing inside.

At times, a trap may be found in the lock of a door or the lock of a Graduates.
The door is a trap. Most of the traps on doors detonate when the door is opened.
Most of the traps on the doors detonate when the door is opened. Most of the traps set in long chests and treasure chests contain poisoned needles or sleeping gas.
There are many different types of chests and treasure chests, including some with poisoned needles or sleeping gas.

If the trap is not set, the animal will be trapped.

Be aware that disarming the trap requires a certain amount of dexterity.
Vo If the value of Dx is about I, it is important to `know one's share'.
If the value of Dx is about I, they will know that it is important to `know their share'. Note that the initiation of such a punishment can sometimes be fatal.
This is a fact that you should be aware of. It is a matter of course, but once the punishment has been triggered, it is not always a good thing.
It is not as if you can find any good in them.

Also, traps on the floor may be discovered by s-command or other means.
The "s-command" may also reveal traps set on the floor or elsewhere. These traps marked with ~ are impossible to dismantle. However, the ^ command is not enough.
However, the ^ command can be used to identify the species of the seed.

Sometimes you have to intentionally trap them in place. For example, a room that has become a secret room.

"Oh, my God, there's nothing here."

Standing in the middle of the darkened room, Teeke's voice sounded drifting.

We went down the stairs and came to this floor, which was the third room, but it was completely empty.
There was nothing at all. There were no missing items, no treasure chests, nothing.
There is no falling equipment, no treasure chest, nothing.

There is no light in any of the rooms we have checked so far, which is why there is `nothing.

Teeke muttered to herself and pulled the backpack off her shoulder.
She walked around the house. She had been pacing around for a long time and had been feeling hungry for some time now.
The teche was a mess. Tique took a package called a K. Ration out of the jumble of packages.
Before she could tear it open, she found a small package of K. Ration. He had only gotten a handful before and kept it instead of eating it right then and there.
I kept it. I was excited to see what they would taste like.

Tzike thinks the food situation in the labyrinth is not so bad. However
But this is only if you don't take taste into consideration.
Oh, no!

Täitke realized that she had left the door to her room open. Once before.

The tiket's eyes lit up as he continued to read the words. The person who wrote the letter was just as excited as Tiket.

They must have been struggling to survive. The feeling of uneducatedness that had been bottled up in the depths of his heart was healed, if only a little.
It felt as if it could be healed.

Yoshitsune flicked his tongue and flicked the meat off the otaku. The wild dog in front of him growled.
The wild dog was growling and chasing the meat in Yoshitune's hand with his eyes.

e

Yoshitune had a fierce battle with some Uruk-hai he met a few floors above, and he was forced to kill his beloved cat, Fo.
When the cat was cut down by Uruk-hai's curved sword, Yoshitsune lost all of his body parts.
It felt as if a part of him had been lost.

At that time, I wondered if I would ever again have a partner in the search for this grotto. (2) I was not so sad.
I never thought that I would experience such sadness and pain.

But now that he had been relieved of the sorrow of losing his wife, he could see how much more important it would be for (3) Josipponne.
He was reminded of how much it had meant to him.

In this bleak and dark cave, only Fomiyi was his friend. They joined forces to fight.
They would fight together, and when they found food, they would approach each other, wary of each other's presence.
They would fight with each other, and when they found food, they would approach each other, wary of each other. On one occasion, Yoshitsune distracted the shopkeeper so that the fomies could steal something from the front of the store.
The owner of the shop would be distracted by Yoshitsune, who would then steal the items on the front of the shop.

The fomiy was an irreplaceable partner.
There is no such thing as a replacement.

Josipponne said to herself whenever she thought of Fomiyi. However, even if it is not a replacement, it is not a replacement.
But it was clear that a new partner, if not a replacement, was needed. The blank space in my heart
A new partner who could make the emptiness in my heart sparkle.

Then Josine met a wild dog. The other adventurers had preceded her to the cave.
It was probably a wild dog that had been left half-dead in a cave by some other adventurer. For a wild dog, it had an unusually shiny black coat.
The black fur of the dog was rather glossy for a wild dog, but it spoke for itself.

As soon as they laid eyes on each other, Josine knew that this dog would be a good partner for her.
I can't say why, but it was the same feeling I had the first time I met a Fomiyi.
I can't say why, but it was the same feeling I had when I first met the Fomiyi.

I will add a "③" to the list of "④". I will add the following.

I pulled a piece of gnawed oak meat out of the backpack and "flicked it in front of him.
I let him try it on me. He was growling, but clearly paying attention to the meat.
I could see that he was paying attention to the meat.

The black dog was a little lost. The black dog was a little confused, but his hunger got the better of him.
He ate the meat.
The black dog was a little confused, but his hunger got the better of him and he ate the meat.

The black dog did not seem to pay any attention to the voice of the man who was eating the meat, and continued to eat. The black dog was completely oblivious to his presence.
The black dog seemed to be completely oblivious to his presence.

Yoshine shrugged her shoulders and left the room. If she couldn't get used to it, then she wouldn't be able to do it.
If she couldn't get used to him, it would be dangerous for her to stay with him. But that is not the case.
But he could not let the black dog go into his hands. If he did, he would have to leave.
He would have to leave.

The moment he put his hand on the knop and opened the door.

In the darkness of the hallway, several arrows flew out. Most of them were shot with his crystal platemail.
Most of them were hit by his crystal platemail, but one of them grazed the edge of his glare.
(1) Only the book grazes the edges of his eyes.
Damn it, what the heck. A poisoned arrow...? Poisoned arrows...?

In Yoshine's mind, the poisoned arrows used by Orc and the others popped into her head, but already in the darkness, the monster Silhouette was coming out of the darkness.
But already a monster silhouette was emerging from the darkness. A half-human, half-horse figure appeared at .......
Khentauros! What brings you to the demon cave of Yender? Kentaus!

The Kentaurs are a tribe that originally inhabited the steppes and mountains. Even though the Yender's cave is large, he is not a member of the Khentauroz race.
Despite the size of the Yender's cave, there is no way that they would live in a cave.

That moment of hesitation leads to Kentaulus' powerful kick to Yoshitane's torso.
Frame 2.

All of the air in her lungs is expelled, and she cannot breathe at all. I can't even breathe.
The eyes are blurred and consciousness drifts through the air.

In the corner of my vision, I saw the hoof of a kentaur. But Yoshitane couldn't even pull out his katana.
Yoshikine could not even pull out her katana.

The moment Josine's consciousness screamed out from somewhere else.

The moment he heard that yelp, he saw that the dog had just bared its fangs at Kentaus's shoulder. I put my head down.

The C and #n commands are both used to give unique names to items and monsters.
The C command can be used to give a monster its own name.

It would be difficult to give a new pet a business name, as in the case of the two victims of the disaster,
It is also a good idea to give a favorite name to a monster you meet on your way to the dangerous lands (who does not challenge you to a fight) to help you identify it.
It would be good to identify the monsters you meet on your way to the dangerous places (that do not challenge you to a fight) by giving them names you like.

The #n command can be used to give a special name to an item, such as a weapon.
The #n command is used to give a specific name to a weapon or other item. The #n commands are used to give special names to the weapons and other items.
This method is useful as a simple distinction when there are several same items. The "Dongno" of Yang can be obtained by the method of preventing the exposure.

Klein sighs as he talks to his cat, Mike.

Mike is not very interested in the cat, and only takes one look at his master, Cline.
Then he began furrowing his fur enthusiastically with his gnarled tongue. At Mike's feet was a freshly eaten doe.
The bones of a freshly-eaten dwarf were scattered around Mike's feet.
This is the one that makes my stomach growl a little.

With a look of satisfaction on his face, Klein approached the fountain that stood out at the edge of the grotto's small room.
With a look of affection, Klein approached the fountain that stood out at the edge of the grotto's small room. The fountain was dark blue and made a small bubbling sound every now and then.
The blue water was a dark blue color and made a small bubbling sound every now and then.

(5) Clain looks at the sword in his right hand.

The cause of the gloom that had been making the normally cheerful man so depressed was there. He was walking through the demon's cave on the upper floor.
He had picked up the sword while he was walking in the demon's cave on the upper floor, and without examining it carefully, he tried to be beautiful with it.
It was wrong of me to try to bequeath it to him without examining it carefully. The sword was under a terrible curse. I'll just throw it away!
The sword would not stay in his hand even if he tried to throw it away, and it seemed to have become part of his right hand.
It was as if it had become a part of his right hand.
I don't have a scroll to break the spell, and I don't have ....... How can I do this?"

As I was muttering to myself, Albena's words came to mind.
Klein, Tomoinmazakata, I'll tell you what to do on your way down.

122 COMMANDS-ERE & 35 { F28DI2-+

Albena, who had won a large sum of money through a drinking game with a big, hulking man, was in a good mood when she began her story.
He was in a good mood and began to talk.
It's hard to continue searching in this cave, but I think it's a curse that's been placed on me.
It's a curse that's been keeping us here for a long time. The fastest way to break this one is to read the scrolls of the curse.
But there are other ways.
"Hes, m-l-i-e-i-d-i-e.

I looked at the drunken and sober pariah about to be led out of the bar all by himself.
Klein asked, looking sideways at the drunken Vaparian who was about to be led out of the tavern alone.
Let's dip the item in the fountain in the cavern," he said. If you are lucky, the spell will be broken.
If you are lucky, the spell will be broken.
What happens if it's bad luck?
It is possible that things will turn out that way.

After saying this, Albena pulled down her dress and saw three warts on her right shoulder and across the valley of her white breast.
Three identical claw marks crept from her right shoulder to the valley of her white breast.
It's a scar from Water Damon's claws," she said.

A faint smile played on Albena's lips as she ran her fingers lightly over the scar on her chest.

Ka'amarjoe

The familiar sound made Klein turn around and see Mike standing behind her.
It's zero.
All right, you just wait there and get down. You never know what you're going to get.

With a slow, deliberate movement, Klein brought his sword to the fountain.
With a slow movement, Klein ran the sword over the fountain. As soon as the blade was all the way into the fountain, someone suddenly emerged from the depths of the fountain.

Out of the water emerged a beautiful woman. Her naked body, which reminded one of a pale girl, was constantly dripping with water.
Her naked body, which reminded one of a pale girl, was constantly dripping water, and her hair was shining with a blue phosphorescent light that trailed down to her feet.

(Mipahta Kasei Tahmin, Changbin, China)

Cline screams in her heart and tries to rush away, but her arms and legs are motionless. But his arms and legs were not moving.
But his arms and legs wouldn't move. He was so mesmerized by the beauty of the nymphs that he couldn't move his body to do anything about it. Even the misanthropic Mike was unable to move his arms and legs.
Even Mike, a misanthrope, was rubbing his cheek against Nymph's foot.

After a few moments, when Klein comes to his senses, Nymph is gone.

That's right, they got him.

When we checked our belongings, we found that some of our items were missing. The only one of them was a bandit.
The only thing that was missing was the bandit, but it was the only thing that was still there.

But then Klein noticed that his right hand was somehow lighter. This led to a smile coming out of Klein's mouth.
A laugh escaped Cline's mouth.

Well, this is a good experience. ......

Klein gives a glance to his right palm.

How dare you! It seems that the Nymphs have even stolen the cursed sword of the astonished species.

There are two ways to use the command #d to soak things. There are two ways to use the command #d to dip the item into the potion.
There are two ways to use the command #d: to soak the item in a pot or to soak it in a fountain.

Dipping the item in a pot makes little sense, especially if you are using a povotion. Especially, it is not a good idea to mix povotion with other povotion.
In most cases, mixing povotion with each other evaporates the povotion or turns it into water.
It is only useful for one purpose: to mix potions together. However, there are some useful uses, such as jujusui, which can be a blessing simply by hitting the item.
Poison can be used to make a powerful poison arrow by hitting it with a bow and arrow.

There are various effects that can be achieved by immersing the items in the fountain. Some are monstrous, others are cursed or blessed.
Some are monstrous, others are cursed or blessed. Prayer
If the player's character is low level, he or she may simply want the Fountain to be blessed.
It would be quite reckless to attach an item to the Fountain simply for the sake of receiving a blessing when the player's character is low. It would be a very reckless thing to do.
It would be wise not to soak the water unless it is absolutely necessary or you are in trouble. It is also rumored that a certain sword is said to have been dipped into a fountain.
(7) If a certain sword is dipped into a fountain, will it be possible to obtain the legendary Excalibur of the Polyjuu Sword?
It is said that it is not possible.

Yoshitsune's consciousness has been clouded by a vague sensation for some time now, and he is not sure if he will be able to find the legendary ex-calibur of the Polyjuu Sword.

o I feel so bad.

He repeated this five times in just a dozen steps down the corridor.
I was in such a bad mood that I repeated it 5 times in just a dozen steps. It was not that there was anything wrong with her body or that she was in pain.
I had no physical problems or pains, but I couldn't deny that I was not in good shape.
I guess that canned food was the last thing I needed. ......

At this point, Josine, who had no monster to eat, found a can in the long chest.
Yoshikine, who did not have any of the monsters that could be eaten, ate the canned food in the long chest without checking the contents.

Then, she began to have a slight fever. He began to feel as if he had a slight fever.
I felt as if I had a slight fever. My hands and feet were oppressed by a floating sensation, and my head felt as if it were in a haze.

During the next interval, Yoshitsune notices that the surroundings are completely different.
It's not the corridor he's been walking in all these years - he's in a wailing dream somewhere.
It is not the corridor where we walked to the end of the street. Not only that, but I could even see a few killer bees in front of me.

Most of the koroesas, the city's property feast, should not be accessible to the public,

In this cave, they have built a safe and have been able to keep their property.

The only thing that was really inside was the money.

How can you save money like that? How can you save so much money?

Joschine spoke lightly, but he soon realized that he could not say such a thing.
But he soon realized that this was not a good time to talk about it. There was no door in the small vault.
The narrow safe deposit box had no door. Only a heap of gold coins was standing there, groaning.
The only thing that could be seen was a heap of gold, stacked in a heap.

Joschine searched desperately for a hidden door, but each wall seemed to be nothing more than a wall.
But all the walls seemed to be nothing more than walls. Half a minute passed, and the door was still not going to appear.
I'm not joking! I'm not going to let you lock me in here! I can't be locked in here!

With a shout, Yoshine pounded on the wall as hard as she could. A pain shot up to Jositne's neck, but she didn't give it a second thought.
Yoshitune didn't care and continued to pound on the wall. If the monster is going to knock me down, I'm going to have to do something about it.
It would have been better to die locked up in a small room like this than to be knocked down by a monster.
It is far from what we want.

Then, just then, the wall opens. Then the wall opens, and a man comes out.
Hmm? I don't know who that is! Who is it?

The moment he looked up, the man raised his voice.
The moment Jositne looked up, the man's voice rose.
I'm Jositne from Samurai, . I've never heard of you. With whose permission did you enter this safe? Who allowed you to enter this safe?
Throw all your money on the floor and follow me. Throw all your money on the floor and follow me, and I will get you out of here.
I'll get it out of here.

There was no way that Joschine would have any objection to this. He had some gold that he had been carrying for some time.
He had some gold that had been in his possession for some time, but it was cheap compared to what he would have to pay for it to rot in such a place.
The gold was not worth the price of the gold.

However, the moment he was about to take the cloth out of the packet, Josine had a feeling that she was about to be taken away from him. The moment he tried to take the cloth out of the packet, however, he felt an unusual sensation.
The moment he was about to take the cloth out of the packet, however, Yoshitane felt a strange sensation welling up from deep inside his body.

There was Kiraby's head in front of Josine's eyes, and from where she could see the head of Kiraby. Then, from somewhere, a shout echoed through the air.
A shout echoed out from somewhere.
It's a bandit! They have teleportation capabilities! They have teleportation skills!

Joschine was listening to the voice of Killer Vippy as she was bathing him with her greatsword.

Apparently, the low canned food contained the meat of a monster that had teleportation capabilities.
It seems that the low canned food contained the meat of a monster that had teleportation ability. The power had transferred to Jositsune's body.

He had remembered the fuming that the Coloethusian guard who was looking for him was a strong warrior.

PSSS is a more powerful Wing than the PSSS verbal communication (9), Mi (3).

The most important thing to remember is that there is no such a thing as a "BAT" in the Terenho-Pokito.
(5) The teleportation ability may be suddenly activated even though there is no BU BAT in the target area. Sudden teleportation
It would be a tragedy (or a comedy) if a sudden teleportation occurred while shopping.
(or even a comedy).

However, it would be a real tragedy (and a comedy) if a teleport were to run away when depleted by the battle. The "war" is a kind of "war" in which the enemy is able to escape by teleportation, or by saving his mobility.
If you can teleport as a means of conserving your mobility, you will be able to run around the caverns more freely.
If the user can teleport, he or she will be able to run around the grotto in an unlimited number of directions. This advantage is something that cannot be discarded.

Despite this convenient teleportation capability, it has only one major weakness.
The teleportation system is not designed to be used in emergency situations. Teleportation is extremely physically demanding. Even if you are full, you can still play teleport.
Even if you're full, you'll still be able to play teleport, but only in the wind of the sky and the rain.
R0W is a great place to be.

Klein stands amidst the goblin and orc corpses lying in a heap.
Breathing heavily, he sheathes his shortsword. Klein's sickle returns blood.
His sickle is bathed in returning blood and is now a deep crimson.

It's a strange house, Mike.

128 COMMANDS 1 To walk through the cave ......

Cline calls out to Mike without looking at him. Mike was not paying attention to Cline or anyone else.
He was focused solely on looking at his own stomach.
I've never been in a room with so many goblins and orcs. I've never seen so many goblins and orcs in one place.
I wonder if there is some great treasure in there.

With a smirk on his face, Klein approached the long chest he had been keeping an eye on between fights.
(8) With a smirk on his face, Klein approached the long chest he had been keeping an eye on during the battle.

The chest had a sturdy-looking lock on it.
Hmmm. Hmmm... looks like it might work.

Cline mutters to herself as she examines the lock from various angles. I think we can find a way to get in.
He takes the lock pick out of the sack containing his cargo and carefully inserts it into the keyhole.
The lock pick is in the lock.

It took a lot of time, but finally Klein's dexterous fingertips loosely pushed the lock pick to the right.
Finally, Klein's dexterous fingertips rotated the lock pick to the right, and the faint sound of the lock disengaging could be heard.

A disappointed cry escapes from Klein's mouth as he peeks into the chest.

He opened the chest to see if the rice paddies were locked up, but inside was a familiar, fierce, and poisonous creature.
Inside was only a bottle of the familiar poison potion.

[I was so surprised that I could not see the poison. I can't believe I'm doing this.

Ji and Klein sat down on the floor of the cave.

The coolness of the rocky skin felt good.

Suddenly, he noticed that Mike's adultery was not visible. He looked to his left and right to see where she had gone.
Looking to his left and right, he felt someone moving in the corner of his vision. It was Kazu, the man on my right.
It was close. It was close.

It was the hobgoblin.

The body of the hobgoblin, which was lying on its back against something, was shaking slightly.
(I'm pretty sure I knocked him over. .....)

While holding his sword at the ready, Klein ponders, a figure appears from the shadow of the Hobgoblin, the only one in the cavern.
As he held his sword and pondered, the shadow of the Hobgoblin revealed his only friend in the caverns.
You did this to me, Mike?

The Hobgoblin, without even looking at Kikkiqhoktapong, continued to eat the infringing hodgepodge of food.
The "Va" is continuing to eat the invading hodgepodge of jellies, which are becoming more and more acute. The fangs of the hobgoblin's arms are now sharper and sharper, and Mike swivels his head left and right.

The beautiful curves were so intricate that they were almost magical to the master craftsman Dwanich's mind, something I had never experienced before.

The queen thought it might be a new kind of trap, and asked Tan if the throne had been visited.

He carefully checked the throne to see if it was visited.

Nothing? What a bore!

As he searched the Palace, Klein uttered more and more monologues.

As he searches for the Palace of the Demons, Klein sits down on the throne with increasing vigor.

With a yell, Klein runs toward the group of monsters.
As for Mike, he was still leisurely going about his business of eating.

If you want to sit on the throne while playing Net Havac, use the #s command.
When you sit on the throne, nothing may happen right away, but after a few cycles, you may find yourself in a variety of situations.
However, after several times of sitting on the throne, various effects will be produced. It is not inevitable that they will have only positive effects for the insured.
Not all of the benefits are good, and sometimes there are two or three disasters.
For example, in some cases, monsters appeared, and in other cases, the owner lost all his money and had to settle for (2) and (5).
The situation is very varied.

Nevertheless, there is value in sitting on the throne. For an adventurous person, it is the best place to sit down.

Mike was staring at the king's line with a scowl on his face.

He was jumping up and down like a flea on Mike's body.

The next thing I know, I'm about to fall into a microphone, and Cline is standing up in a panic,
Fugia!

Mike's long, proud tail is trampled by Tak Ryan, and he lets out a heartbreaking cry.

"Bad, bad, bad!

Mike gives a resentful cry at Cline's pestering.

The first thing that comes to my mind is the fact that I am not a good person.
I'm not sure what to say, but I'm sure you'll be able to find the answer in the next few days.

Turning his head away from the soluble Klein, Mike moved to the corner of the room.
He wisely decided that it would be better for him to be away from this strange master for now.

When Mike turned around, still close to the door of his room, Klein was still bored with his work.
He was still jumping around in his jumping boots. Mike was looking for something nearby to play with.
Mike looked around to see if there was anything nearby that he could play with, but only found a rotting dead jackal.

Mike screamed in agony as his tail was stepped on again.

The result is the one shown in (8).

(4) Yes. This is a good time to show ... Wait, I can use this one right now: ......".

When the sound of footsteps approached, reminiscent of the sound of the Ogre's earth, Klein put all the energy he could muster into both feet.
With all the strength he could muster, he poked the ground with both feet. His body, lifted in the air, flew through the drop hole, and he was able to see Mike's eyes.
The body of the floating creature jumped over the drop hole and rolled right in front of Mike. At once, a loud noise echoed through the grotto.

The ogre is yelping angrily, baring its sharp, bicuspid teeth.

Come on," he said. I'm going to make you some food, okay?

Mike cries out in delight.

Clain changed his weapon to a bow and aimed the poisoned arrow at the ogre.
He then fired an arrow at Ogre, which was filled with the poison.

Strangely enough, behind the dragon was Mike. It was a small leopard.
The dragon was walking with a gentle bend and a gentle bow.

The sharp tusks of the dragon's mouth emitted a voice.

The dragon's voice was strangely hoarse, perhaps due to the lack of vocal organs, but there was no doubt that it was Kragoj.
It was definitely Klein's voice.

I had heard there was a ring that could turn into a monster, but ...... I didn't know it was this one.

Suddenly, Mike lets out a cry of intimidation.

Clain bent his long neck to look ahead and saw a monster.
It was a monster.

On top of the humanoid creature's huge body grew the head of an ugly cow. The horns were broken.
Under the broken horns, the monster's deep red eyes stare at Klein.

It seemed to be searching for the dragon it had been fighting, trying to find out where it had gone.

Suddenly, Minotaur looks down and sees Cline. A moment of silence.
After a moment of silence, a growl is heard and fangs are bared from a burned mouth.

Yo, Nek ... let's get out of here! *!

With a yell, Klein took Mike and ran away.

Wipe face with a wipe.

Cline was running in a cave.

His and Mike's bodies were covered in white creams and crusted pies.
He and Mike were covered in white creams and crusted pie skins.

They reached the door of the room, and when they tried to open it, it was locked. Quickly, the lock bips open and the door is locked.
Quickly, he took out the lock bipick and found that the cabin was locked.

A man wearing strange clothes came running out of the door behind which Klein had entered.
A man in a strange outfit came running out of the door behind Klein. As soon as they saw Klein, they threw a cream pie into his hand.
They started throwing the cream pies in their hands. One of the pies hit Klein in the face as he turned around.

Mwah!

(8) The player wipes his hands on the slippery ream that Cline has just put on his face.
(2) Neku shakes his face violently to the left and to the right to hit the pai.

(Was that the best he could do?)

While opening the door, Klein blurts out, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

This strange escape began with an incident in a store.
Come here, Klein! You are welcome at the Tom's roll-up store.

Cline, who had been searching the cave, opened the door to her room as usual.
When he opened the door to his room as usual, he was greeted by a cheerful voice.

Standing in front of the startled Klein was a short, elderly man.
He was a short, elderly man. The black rope covering his body reminded me of a face covered with keys and a dead branch.
The skinny arms were visible through the black ropes that covered his body.

Behind the old man's still, smiling face, a myriad of scrolls lay haphazardly on the ground.
Behind the old man's still, smiling face, numerous rolls were randomly placed on the ground. Cline entered the store with trepidation, and saw the eye rolls at his feet.
He picked up one of the eyeglasses that lay on the floor at his feet. The old man immediately offered to sell him the price of the scroll he had picked up.
The old man immediately offered me the price of the scroll in his hand.
What is the price of the roll? What exactly is this scroll? What kind of roll is it?

Cline unrolls the roll and begins to whisper, slurring an unintelligible word.

I'm not sure what to do.
Hmmm. Goodness gracious, I'm glad I kept my hands on the reins.

Mike's eyes were glazed over as he looked around the area.

P 2) Icky.

Suddenly, an alarm echoes through the cavern.
What is that sound? What is that sound?

Klein whispered, his face scrunched up at the noise.

Somewhere in the darkened room, a door opens.

And then ...... The first cream pie hit the side of Klein's face as he ran out of steam.

Behind Klein and Mike, the strangely dressed men are still chasing after them.
The chasing party is still on the move. One after another, the pursued Clain opened the door, and suddenly a small carving appeared.
A small sculpture shattered in front of him.

I wonder if he's going to pay us? And do you want some more cream pie?
I wonder.

It was the owner of the roll shop with the black robes. The old man's friendly smile faded from his face.
The smile on the old man's face was gone, and his voice was dry and cold.

It seemed that the old man had returned to the roller shop while he was trying to escape.
Behind the old man, men with creampies and gumballs were waiting for Klein's answer.
He was waiting for Klein's answer.

I know, I know.

With a sigh, Klein pays the old man for the roll.

When Klein gives the money, the men disappear instantly, leaving the old man behind.
Glimmering

I am afraid and pale.

In front of the whispering Klein, the owner of the scroll shop begins to calculate the amount of money.
Mike, who was standing next to Klein, was licking the clean silk on his neck to make it look delicious.
He was a good man, and he was a good man.

Use the #w command to wipe your face.

Normally, using a #w command only removes dirt from the face, but with cream pies, etc., you can see the eyes.
However, if you are blinded by a creampie or other accident, you can use the commands to help you out of a state of blindness.
The KiMeDanRiHo is a fine piece of equipment that can be used to help you sail away from a blind state.

The #w command may not be used often, but in a cave, it can be used to help you escape from blindness.
I don't know how crazy things can get in the cave, so I'm not going to go into it with a plan.
(9) The plot is not a picture.

The city of vice, where the center of Gilded the Thief is in power.

Zardoz, which has become almost entirely a lawless district due to its poor security, was once home to a tavern called the Golden Horn.
In one corner of the street was a tavern called the Golden Horn.

On his way back from his training in Guild, Klein opened the door to the tavern to have a drink before heading back to his lodgings.
When he opened the door to the tavern, he found that it was unusually crowded that day. I found a seat that was reasonably full.
I found a seat that was open and had a good drink when a new customer took the seat next to Klein.
A new customer took the seat next to Klein.

Gross, a wizard-less man who was also the owner of the tavern "The Horned Horn of Shell Gold. The fat man's flesh twitched up and down in time with Gros's laughter.
The flesh of his bloated body yawned up and down.

As he put down the cup of his smoothly connected ale, Klein looked over to see the man next to him.
He looked down to see a woman with a dirty leather cloak on her arm.
From under the hood, I could see the woman's face. The woman's beautiful blonde hair falls from under the hood.
| The woman's blonde hair falls out from under her hood.

The woman calls out to Gros.
It's almost over. I'm done. Go and have a drink.

Gros pours a drink into a silver dulcimer, which he does not use most of the time. The amber-colored liquor was offered to him.
The woman wipes her wet lips with her left hand and smiles as she takes a swig of the amber-colored drink.

Gloss and the woman exchange a few words, but when a new guest finally arrives, Gloss is left with no more words.
When a new customer came in, Gross went to take the order, regretfully. The woman took the heavy sake pot in her right hand.

Klein and Albena both spit their drinks in front of each other, and they both had enough to drink at the same time.

Monsters Foreword

Yama
A leech ape, carnivorous ape

The baboon (ape) is a gigantic primate that may reach several meters in length. They are also a chimpanzee-eater.
Because they are carnivorous, they sometimes thatch their meat on the stomachs of their gastropods.

Baboons are often in groups that are led by a post. Therefore, even if one baboon
If one baboon gets one, there are probably several more waiting behind it. When the body strength is low, for example, it may be difficult for the fish to move.
This is a partner you need to be careful of when your strength is low. Do not play in the center of a large room.
Instead, you should try to lure them into a narrower space to fight. However, a baboon's weapons, other than its teeth, are only as weak as its claws.
However, the baboon's weaponry, other than its teeth, is limited to its meager claws, which would not be much of a threat to a well-equipped grievance hunter.
It should not be too intimidating for a well-equipped stomachic.

Carnivorous baboons (carnivorous ape) are a species of baboons that have long been carnivorous, but have become carnivorous as a result of their long history of feeding on meat.
The carnivorous ape is an omnivorous baboon that has become more frenzied due to its long history as a carnivore, and its body size is almost twice that of a normal baboon.
The Yerender baboons are particularly well-known for their aggressive behavior, especially in the area of the throat. The ones that live in the Yerender's cave are especially fond of human flesh.
They seem to be particularly fond of human flesh, so the unwary should beware. However, these are cosmetics.
However, they are less likely to act cosmetically and more likely to wander around as loners.
In general, they are easier to subdue than baboons because they are less likely to act under the covers and more likely to roam alone.
The baboons are often more likely to wander than normal baboons, and in general they are easier to knock down.

Baboon meat is considered to be one of the most delicious of all the monsters in Yerender's cave.
At least twice as tasty as at the Gates of Uccleay.

Buckeye bat, giant bat, vampire bat

The cormorant lives in the darkest of Yerender's grottoes. The grottoes are the caves of the Yenders and their lackeys.
The grotto is an artifact produced by Yender and his lackeys, but it seems to have settled on the surface.
It seems to have taken up residence on the surface.

When they see an unscrupulous intruder, they leap upon him with their tiny fangs to defend their territory.
They leap at them with their swords to defend their territory. However, because they are not very powerful, they are not easily repelled.
They would be easy to fight off. However, the behavior of the flying squirrels is not consistent.
I would like you to pay attention to that part alone. When they are close, they are far away; when they are close, they are far away; when they are close, they are close.
The fact that they approach when you think they are approaching makes them extremely difficult to target.

The vyampire bat is basically the same as the giant cormorant.
The vyampire bat is basically the same as the giant cormorant, but it is said to have a deadly poison in its fangs. Rumor has it that the blood-sucking cormorant is the same as the giant cormorant, but it is said to have a deadly poison in its fangs.
There are rumors that the vampire cormorant is the form it takes when it undergoes a transformation. This is a vampire-cum-mortal.

The monsters that haunt the demon cave

The rumor may have originated from the fact that the cucumbers clearly heal faster than other cucumbers.

C Centaurs plain centaurs, forest~, mountain~.

The kentaur is an annual half-horse archer whose upper body is human and lower body is horse.
He is a master archer with a human upper body and a horse lower body. A kentaur is usually a horse in the lower half of the body, as mentioned above, but sometimes a kentaur is a man and a horse in the upper half of the body.
However, it is sometimes possible to find kentauros that have only the hind legs (2) instead of the legs (4).
However, sometimes you can find a kentaur with only the hind legs (2) instead of the legs (4). This may be a kind of clear-cut form.

In some areas, there are also leonine kentaurus, which have the lower body of a lion, and in other areas, leonine kentaurus have the upper body of a lion, and in other areas, leonine kentaurus have the lower body of a lion. Also, in some areas, there are leontokentauros, which are lions.
In some areas, there are leontokentauros, which are lions, and ofkentauros, which are inbred horses. Some of them are half man and half dragon.
There are some rare half-human, half-dragon Drakken⑳i & ip Yang tribe. In order to distinguish them from other toys,
In order to distinguish them from the original kenkroses, we sometimes call them "E. mapochthys tulosus".

In the Grotto of Yender, there is a plain centaur that lives in the steppes and a forest forager that lives in the forests.
The forest centaur, the forest centaur, the forest centaur, the forest centaur, the forest centaur, the forest centaur, the forest centaur, the forest centaur, the forest centaur, the forest centaur, the forest centaur, the forest centaur, and the mountain centaur (see Figure 5).
The existence of mountain centaurs has been reported.

The mountain centaur should have been a nature-loving creature, but why does it live in the duck caves of Yonta?
It is not well known why they came to live in the duck caves of Yonta.

Their main weapon of choice is the bow and arrow, but when fighting up close, they can also use their powerful kicks from their horses' legs.
In up-close fighting, they sometimes carry out powerful kicks from the legs of their horses. If they are defeated, they will be rewarded with a longbow and an arrow of the ikbakka.
If you defeat them, you will be able to use the long paw and the ichibakka arrow.

Dragon is not the kind of legendary entity that comes to life in a child's bedtime story.
It is not the kind of legend that comes to life in a child's bedtime story. In the lowest levels of Ye-Ender's grotto, several types of dragons have already been identified.
The Lilo, however, is not a "Lilo". However, very few people have seen the eyes and returned to life, and even those who have returned to life have not been able to find their long awaited presence.
However, very few people have returned after seeing the LOs, and even those who have returned have generally refused to talk about the Dragons, as if they were afraid of their presence.
They are afraid to talk about the Dragon, as if they are afraid of the presence of the waiting. For this reason, only very little information is known about them.
The only thing that is known is that they are not going to talk about the Lagoon.

The species of dragons can be distinguished by the color of their scales. The pugilist
The breath of the dragons varies depending on the color of their scales. The most common species is the basket 賣, which is a type of urophylla.
The dolphins are said to spit out concentrated acid, toxic gases, and freezing fluid from their mouths. Currently, it has not been confirmed.
This is about all that is currently known of the dragon's capabilities.

Their large claws and fangs are said to be able to pierce even platemail. More details.

In this case, the need for further research is extremely high.

It has also been confirmed that they are oviparous. Young dragoons, fresh from the egg, are the only ones that can survive in the deep water.
They have been confirmed in relatively shallow layers, perhaps because young dragons cannot survive the intense competition for survival in deeper layers.
Juvenile dragons are found at relatively shallow depths. Juvenile dragons breathe the dreaded dragon breath, ZERTES, only at their disposal.
The juvenile dragons are often repelled by adventurers, as they fight only with their fearsome dragon breath. N. sicutum
This may be one of the reasons why there are so few adult N. siceraria.

Also, it is possible that a brand-name sword, forged solely for the purpose of defeating the Dragons, was found somewhere in the demon's cave in Jendal, and the user was not able to use it.
Somewhere, in the depths of Yenda's maze, they lie dormant, waiting to be used.

By nature, these spirits are nothing more than beings that exist in the spirit world, enjoying a state of tranquility. However, due to their powerful magical power, they are distorted by the next sky.
However, because they have been dragged out by a powerful magical force into the magical cave of the distorted Yenders of the next sky, they, too, have become distorted spirits of the Monster Spirits.
They become spirits and monsters that confront mankind as monsters.

Some would spread high fever when struck with a sword or other weapon, while others would take the offender inside their own bodies and inflict great damage.
Some of them can cause a great deal of damage by capturing the offender in their own body.

However, outside of Yender's grottoes, it is unlikely that one will ever spot a mad spirit.

The giant mosses are notorious for their aggression. Giant mosses have the ability to scatter their internal spores around by the impact of an incoming blow.
Giant mosses have the ability to scatter their internal spores all around them upon impact. These spores contain a strong acidic soda, which can attach to the skin of organisms.

Some of them emit abnormal heat when they are heated. Therefore, it is not surprising that the fearful fluency of the method and the (mouth or mouth) may be reduced if the crude fungus is found.
The most likely method is to look at the iR, dR, and see if there are any other bacteria that can be used to kill the crude fungi.

It was only a matter of time.

In modern times, they are rarely seen in public and are treated as `legendary creatures', but this is a misperception.

These are the men who are contracted by the merchants to protect the stores that are located in the caves of the Yenders.
They are the ones who have contracts with the merchants in the Yender's cave and protect the shops. They are the ones who have signed a contract with the shop, which is located in a brothel of Yenders, and they are the ones who protect the shop.
They are there to make sure that shoppers who misbehave and somehow shoplift valuable goods from the stores pay for them. If you hear the alarm ringing in the den, you should be aware of it.
If you hear the alarms ringing in the cave, you should be careful. These security guards were sent by the owner of the store to investigate where the alarms were coming from.
It means that these guards have appeared from somewhere at the request of the shopkeeper. They are the only ones who can tell where the criminal is, as long as he is present.
They will probably come to the store to ask the owner where he is.

The punishment is to be imposed on the offender for committing a major crime, such as shoplifting with a terrible weapon, a rubber hose.

However, if the shoplifter is fully repentant and is willing to pay the shopkeeper, then they should be punished for their crime.
If the shoplifters are fully repentant and are willing to pay the shopkeepers, they will probably simply disappear (even while clucking their tongues). When they disappear, they will appear just as they did when they first appeared.
Needless to say, they will not disappear as suddenly as when they first appeared.

L Richie lich, demi~, master~.

A lich is a sorcerer who has gained eternal life through the great magic of the ancients or through the power of an evil god.
Richichi is the general name for those high priests who were immortalized by the power of an evil god. The source of their cursed lives
The source of their cursed lives is half in the world of the dead and the other half in the world of the living,
Their souls are said to be immortal in this world.

They became Richie because of their strong will to manipulate the laws of immortality, which is known as the Heathen Laws.
Their magical powers are nothing short of spectacular. Because they are immortal, the study of witchcraft is a long time in the making.
They are immortal, and they have spent many years in the study of sorcery. And as a result, they have been able to manipulate the magic that is there.
It is possible to split the earth, summon a storm, and create a magic fire.

And anyone who comes into contact with his body will be squeezed out of his spirit because of Richie's excessive psychic power.
The mere touch of his fingers is enough to cast a spell on all things.

As mentioned above, half of the source of their life is in the realm of death.
Therefore, their lives are not based on the death of the body, but on the death of the soul. For this reason, their bodies cannot be harmed by ordinary weapons, but only by the magical powers of their weapons.
Some believe that they are able to injure the invaders with their magical powers.

The presence of others, such as those that spit venom, those with paralyzing poison in their fangs, and those that can hold magic, has been confirmed. The one that breathes fire seems to have red scales, but it is not clear how the remaining naga are able to do so.
The details of how the remaining naga live are unknown. Most of the aforementioned characteristics, etc., are not visible to the naked eye.
Most of the aforementioned characteristics are based on eyewitness accounts, so I will leave it at that.

In the Grotto of Yender, their presence has been confirmed from the middle to the deepest levels.
In particular, the presence of the "Grotto of Yender" has been confirmed in the middle and deeper levels. The guardian naga, especially in Gade, is known for its powerful presence.

AbhB--T-VA (straw eol⑧in) made from taro, rope golem made from taro, and leather golem made from leather.
(The following three types of golems are used: rope golem, leather golem, and wood golem.
Wood golems, flesh golems made of pieced together corpses.
Flesh golems (fesh golems), clay golems (clay clods), and stone stoops (stone masonry).
Stone golems (stone golems), iron golems (iron golems), and other types of golems.
There are many different types of golems, including clay golems, stone golems, and iron golems.

A golem faithfully and accurately obeys the orders of its creator.
The effectiveness of the order is only as strong as the fact that the golem's body is completely crushed or that the guard changes the order.
The order continues to be effective until the guard changes the order and the golem is completely crushed.

Some golems have special abilities. For example, a rope gollem can
For example, a lope gollem can entangle a lope in an enemy's body, rendering it immobilized, and a stone gollem can make a poison mist from its mouth into the enemy's mouth, making the enemy unable to move.
For example, a lope gollem will lure a lope from the enemy's body, making him immobile, while a stone gollem will spray a poisonous mist from his mouth at his opponent.

The Gorlems' defensive, unmoving attacks are as terrifying as they are powerful.
The savers are not the only ones who are afraid to take their own lives. If the savers think they can't beat you, it's a good strategy to escape.

' eel, electric eel kraken giant eel, electric eel kraken

It is said that the depths of the cave are inhabited by kraken. The common edible sea urchin, for example, is said to be a species that does not cause harm to humans.
The grotto inhabitants, however, can easily take the lives of the sick and wounded.
The sea urchin in the grotto has become such a dangerous creature that it can easily take the lives of the sick and injured.

Giant giants (gianteel) attack the afflicted with their hideous tusks, and electric giants (electriceel) are also known to attack the afflicted.
The gianteel attacks the afflicted with its hideous tusks, while the electriceel uses its tusks to deliver an electric current that can kill a buffalo with a single blow.
The electriceel would then deliver a current of electricity to the enemy that would kill the buffalo with a single blow. But the most terrifying aspect of the raccoons' attacks is that they are so powerful that they can kill a buffalo with a single blow.
The most terrifying part of a wildebeest attack is the way they cling to the enemy with their long, thick torso and drag him into the water to fight.

The kraken is a legendary monster from the coastal areas of Norway.

The kraken is so large that its adult form is not known in detail. However, legend has it that they are
Legend has it that it floats on its back like a small island among the waves, with shells and sometimes even trees growing on its back, and that it can be seen from the water.
It is said to be able to extend its tentacles, which are neither arms nor horns, from the water longer than a boat's mast.
They are said to be able to extend their tentacles, which are neither arms nor horns, longer than a ship's mast from the water.

Because of their large size, kraken are slow-moving, so attacking them with swift movements is a very effective method of attack.
This is an effective strategy. However, if caught by the tentacles of a kraken, it will be dragged deep into the water.
If a kraken's tentacles catch you, you may be dragged underwater, so be very careful during a fight. If you are pulled underwater, it is a hazard.
If you are trapped in the water, there is no way to save your life. This is because water is their best battlefield.
It is their favorite battlefield.

@ humans destroying humans, elves, were-creature, Medusa, The Wizard

Many humanoid monsters live in caves.

There are war creatures that transform into beasts, a tribe of elves, and soldiers.
A wide variety of races await the adventurers at the bottom of the cavern.

Medusa, the most fearsome of these monsters, is also humanoid. &.
Each strand of hair on the woman's head is covered with poisonous snakes, and even if she were to bite Medusa's head off, the poisonous snakes would still be able to attack her.
Even if she did, the poisonous snake would bite the offender.

Medusa's offense against the enemy is simply to point her red twin beams of light at her opponent.
The attack by the medusa against the enemy is as simple as turning its red twin view toward the opponent. However, the effect is enormous, and the woman's evil eye will see it.
Those who are discovered by her evil eye are turned into stone statues. However, such a Medusa is also a woman of great power.
But even Medusa could be easily killed with a shield. The Greeks.

The exact nature of the attacks of the wizard Yender remains a mystery.

The ghosts are said to have become ghostly spirits that haunt the earth. In the underground labyrinths of Yendaa, there were also apparitions, and many of them lost their lives on the way to the Gastroplacrimal Hazard.
Many of them are the frozen grudges of those who have lost their lives on the way to the Gastrovascular Disaster.

Very few people have survived the haunts of the Yenders. The Eender's
The number of people who have survived the Yenders' mVh exhibition or summit can be counted on one hand.
They are heroes, or at least they were. They became heroes, or even more than heroes.
No one can say for sure whether they were the ones who took Monda's closing mütz in the Red Sea.
The first two are the same.

I will search the depths of the magical inn.
Some people searched deep into the magical world and were not able to return. Diores is one of them.
He is one of them. When he came out of Yender's cave, his chestnut-colored hair had turned gray and he was proud of his strength.
His once-strong body was as emaciated as that of an old man.

I asked many questions about Jender's cave. However, the grotto was not his body.
But the cave was not only his body, but also his spirit. Diores's answer was fragmentary and unhelpful.
Diores's answer was fragmentary and ambiguous, and at times it seemed to make no sense at all.
It seemed as if it had no meaning at all at the time. He would suddenly answer a question that had been asked two minutes earlier, or simply blurt out a monologue.
DZEDDHoTDIZ,.

I combined these waiting stories with the rumors and rumors that had been circulating until now, and I was able to find a way to get to the bottom of what was going on in Jendahl's cave.
I have succeeded in combining these stories of waiting with the rumors and other information that have been circulating and compiling them into a report for those who go to Yender's cave. However, the information contained in this article is not the only information that is available to those who go to Yender's cave,
However, I cannot judge whether this information is correct or incorrect.
I cannot judge whether the information is correct or incorrect.

I hope you will go to the Yenders' dungeon and confirm the truth of this information for yourselves.
I want you to confirm the truth of this information.

I dedicate this book to all the crazy warriors out there who love this book.

250 INFORMATIONS 1. To break through the maze.

I met a man named Deiores.

He lived under a bridge near the favela. He lived under a bridge just outside the favela, in an abaraya that he was afraid to call home.
His home was an abaraya, a kind of abaraya that I would be hesitant to call a home. A warrior as active as he was would have had a house as grand as he wished.
A warrior of his stature should have been able to build as grand a house as he wished. But the very spirit of the man himself was not the same,
But would his very spirit have wanted him to live in a place with such a name?

The place I intend to visit is the home of a man named Deiores.

Until a few years ago, he was a well-known barrier barrier. He was proud of his great size, and with a great sword in his hand, he could cut down everything.
He used to brag that he could cut through everything with the great sword in his hand.

He was so proud of his great size that he claimed to be able to cut through everything with the great sword in his hand.
He was a man of great strength.

Although he was unable to obtain an amulet from Yender, Dioreth was able to find a way to escape from the grotto.
Although he was unable to break free of the enchantment, De Ores returned from the grotto.

She returned with many treasures.

If only that had been the case, he would have been a hero.
But he did not.

However, today's Diores is much further away from such a bush.
The first is (1), the second is (8), the third is (9), and the fourth is (10).

When he crawled out of the cave, his muscles were so full that they could not be cut through steel.
When he crawled out of the cave, his muscles, which had been so full that they could have cut through steel, had atrophied to the point of being useless.

Her chestnut hair, which had been looked upon with envy by many of her daughters, had turned gray.

Her eyes had lost their sparkle and were now colored with fear. The words that spilled out of his mouth made no sense.
The words coming from So did not make any sense.

What fear had seized him, I, who am not God, have no reason to know.

But there was a place of fear, a place of sharpness, a place of peace.

The spirit of Deiolis had been shattered in the cave of Ye-Ender. Since then, he has been holed up in this cabin.
Since then, they have holed themselves up in these huts, cut off from human contact, and lived in the darkness. Sometimes he would go out into the city.
Sometimes he would go out into the city and sell the treasures he had acquired in Yender's cave for two or three thousand rupees, and then live off the money.

She met a man named Deiores 251

e [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [

I'm not sure how I feel about that.
Those who knew him in the past would have been astonished at how different he was.
Today's audiovisuals are more like him. Nowadays, Diores is a living, breathing wraith.
But his foray into the depths of the Yender's cave was unmistakable.

It is a fact. His threshold knowledge would have been of great significance to my research.

And so I stood at the door of his house.

When I opened the door, a single knock was enough to make the door topple over, so I rudely knocked on the door.
I was about to knock on the door and it seemed that the door was about to fall down, so I rudely omitted the knocking.
When the light shone through the doorway, two eyes were seen in the depths of the darkness.
The children of the country's courageous youths.

As soon as the light came in, he moved. Into the faint darkness that remained in the corner of the room. As if to avoid the light.
He was trying to avoid the light (⑧).

He threw things at me as he saw fit. I couldn't even get a thatched roof.
I was not sure what to expect from him, but I was sure that I would be able to find a way to get him to come back to me.
I am not sure that I am the kind of person who can interact and conspire with other ashes.
I am not sure if it's a good idea.

Thus, my first meeting with Diores ended in despair. Even after I left him, he was still looking at the light.
After I left, he continued to throw things around as if he abhorred the light itself, scattering them all around his place of residence.
He continued to throw things around his place of residence as if they were an abomination to light itself.

Communication, our first face to face meeting.

Nevertheless, I did not give up and visited him several more times. Of course.
I brought him some souvenirs.

Diores, who had been afraid of me at first, began to open up to me more and more,
As long as he was mentally healthy, we would have a few conversations.

Conqueror was especially fond of drinking. Drunkenness removed the fear from his heart, which was shattered by fear.
The drunkenness may have removed the fear from Wait's heart, which had been shattered by fear.

That day, too, he brought with him a drink called `the spirit of Drac'. He had never been so afraid.

After repeating these seemingly meaningless words, his eyes drifted into the void.
His eyes were drifting in the void. He seemed to be thinking about something from the bottom of his heart.
He was thinking about something deep in his heart.

Suddenly, there was a light in his eyes. It was as if something had moved into his waiting. No, no, no,
Perhaps this is his true form.

His lips, which had been open in a peculiar manner, were tightened, his eyes were bright and shining, and his appearance was completely different from the one he had just seen in his earlier days.
He was a completely different person from Deiores. The expression of a warrior had returned.
He was a warrior again.
Sometimes he could be found in a corner of an armory or a junk shop.
It must have been sold off by an adventurer who was in desperate need of money. It was expensive and I could not pawn it with my own money.

It was hard to tell if he was the same man I had met the first time.

Next, I asked him if a temple existed in the Hellhole of Yeänder. From several sources, I was able to find out that there was a temple in the cave of Yerender.
From some of the information I had gathered, I had an idea that there might be a temple there, but I did not know why it was there.
But I had no idea why the temple was there. Now, Deolores was a demon.

Praying to God on the surface of the cave is the most important thing. It is more important to pray to God on the surface of the grotto.
By taking God as your ally, you will be able to get through the various difficulties that arise in the grotto.

Deolens brushed her hair back and held her head. Her eyes had completely lost their light.
I'm not going to let you do this to me.
You can't take out the protective gear at Mutsuzaki and be afraid of the devil ... o It's a cursed view.
If you find a cursed view, read the scroll that destroys the armor. If the view is cursed, read the scroll that destroys the armor.

The conquest of the armor is essentially a puppet for the effective use of a tool that is not likely to stand up afterwards.

260 INFORMATIONS 1 1 1 1 To break through the cave

He seemed to be able to read. He read the material I had on hand (to my surprise, he could read) and gave me examples of how it could be useful to use it in ways other than the `orthodox' way.
), and gave an example of how it can be useful to use it in a way other than its `natural' use.
Pan, who was 1) at 0.

No, he was probably just recalling his own experience and saying it out loud.
I think he was just thinking about his experience and saying it as it was. As proof, there was nothing willful in his tone. ....... and

The only evidence for this is the fact that the tone of the wait did not seem to have any willfulness. Deionce is back to being a semi-sick person.
But, in the midst of all this, the patient was still very sick. But even in the midst of all this, he can't seem to forget about the cave.
He can't seem to forget about the cave. ``I'm sure he can't forget the grotto.

What he saw in the grotto, I do not know. But what he saw in the grotto, I do not know.
What he saw in the grotto, I do not know, but what he saw in the grotto will haunt him with such abominable memories.
I wonder what kind of things they see in their eyes and how they are trapped in such an abominable memory. As a researcher of grottoes, this is an interesting subject, but I myself would like to experience something like this myself.
I did not think I would like to experience it myself.

The Food Situation in the Grotto

It had been about a month since I first asked about his house. I still have not been able to find him.
His mental condition was still relatively good. He was still in a relatively good state of mind.
He would even greet me. It seems that his spirit has been reconstructed by our conversations.
& &

On this particular day, I asked Diores about the food situation in the grotto. I brought some food with me.
Some people seem to bring in a little food, but the grotto is dozens of stories below ground.
It is not possible to bring all the food necessary for a few days of tramping through Yonder's caverns, which are dozens of stories below the ground.

261

It is almost impossible.

This question was finally answered by Diores.
Don't you know that many of the monsters in the cave can be eaten? And there is a food store.
There are food stores and food drops here and there. We can get enough nutrients.
We can get enough nutrients, and we can even go on the rare occasion that we are hungry. Well, I've been hungry.
Well, I'm hungry a lot, but it's not that painful. However, I don't know how I feel about the taste.
I don't know if you've ever eaten Norijak meat.
I've never eaten Norwegian meat. You may not even want to eat it, but it's necessary.
The food situation in the caves of the Yenders is not that bad, as long as you don't overdo it on the taste.
The food situation in Yeddah's cave did not seem so bad. However, I did not think I would eat the meat of Yakitori or Migi-kimi.
I wouldn't want to eat the meat from the mouths of the birds.

Moreover, Diores had given him some valuable information about the taste and smallness of monster meat.
2T ATz

[The monster's meat has special powers that can be acquired by eating the meat of a monster with special powers.
The woman was too lazy to go to the lake. After eating an ant that has the ability to withstand fire, the fire will feel hot.
The fire was hot and the ants were weak. There are many ants that can withstand fire (8) But not a few of them contain poison.
Some of them were so poisonous that we could not understand what they were as soon as we ate them.
Once you eat them, you will never forget them, but it would be the worst thing to be attacked by another monster immediately after eating them.
Being attacked by another monster right after eating such an item was the worst thing that could have happened....

I have heard this story a few times. Replacorns, or nymphs, for that matter.
It is said that a person who eats the flesh of a monster with transdimensional power, such as a Replacon or a Nymph, gains that transdimensional power.
It is a kind of story in which a person who eats the flesh of a monster with transdimensional power, such as a nymph, obtains that transdimensional power. However, this story is about a man who can control his power, and who is able to enter the walls of the world.
But these stories often end with `I get inside the wall where I can't control the power and end up dying.
It was very difficult to determine whether it was just a legend or the truth.
Tsubame S.

According to his story, obtaining this kind of ability was not always a certainty.
It seems that it is not always a certainty, but more or less a matter of luck. The more powerful the monster is, the more likely it is that it will be able to achieve its potential.
The more powerful the monster was, the easier it seemed to gain power.

Later, Diores' talk turned to the characteristics of many of the monsters. The characteristics of the monsters were discussed.
The details of the characteristics of these monsters are described in detail in my book "The Book of Enchanted Cave Exploration: The Biology of Monsters.
B, please refer to them in detail. I have also referred to many of the honors of the "Mimamori" in my book.

262 INFORMATIONS 1. To break through the cave

The following is a summary of the results of the study.

DeGeolens admitted that he had even defeated the Piedragonmi. His discourse was not the only one.
There was nothing in the story that was true, but it is probably true. It could be a juvenile dragon.
It may have been a juvenile dragon.

The Last Hour - His Death

It has been a long time since I first visited Wait's house.

That day, I had almost finished the book and went to Deion Leslie to have it checked.
I had almost finished the book and went to Deion Leslie to check it out. But what I found at his house was the remains of a waiting list.

He had some treasures - probably from the Ejender's Grotto - that he had acquired.
He was lying dead in his bed, having sorted out his treasures. And beside him was a suicide note addressed to me.

According to the will, Diores was aware that he had a mental disorder.
He was also aware of his own mortality. He also knew that he had very little life left in him, which is why his mind was so clear.
He knew that his life was very short, so he tried to give me as much information as he could while his mind was still clear.
I was very grateful to him for his kindness.

I have been able to share with him as much information as I can by writing about my experiences in the cave.
I hope that by writing about the various things I have experienced in the grotto, there will be fewer people like him who fall into madness.
I hope that by writing this report, there will be fewer people like him who fall into madness.

Therefore, this book, which was supposed to be my research and circulated among a small group of people, was not published.
The book became publicly available.

Again, in the past, Diores was a strong warrior. He had become such a mighty man.
There is such madness in the cave that it would take a man of this stature to become such a madman. And he could not fight this madness.
Those who cannot fight this madness, no matter the treasure they hope to find, will not be able to stand in the grotto of the Yender.
Those who cannot fight this madness will not stand in the grottoes of the Yenders, even if they have the treasure in their sights.

It is a trial that may cost more than their lives, and they will have to pay a price for it.
We would be happy if you could understand the wishes of Diores.
