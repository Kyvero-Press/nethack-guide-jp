The star is then wrapped around the wall and disappears into a corner of the room.

Electricity, fire, and magic of all kinds were of no use to Teeke.
The qualities he had acquired in the course of his wanderings through the cave, or the weapons he had acquired, rendered the light and magic of the indirect attacks ineffective.
The most powerful hoe was the one that could be used to cut down the enemy's armor. And the most powerful hoe, the Skylmaei, is protected by the scales of the Glade Dragon.
The skeil mail, protected by the scales of the most powerful hoe, protected Teeke from almost all attacks.

The dragon withstood several slashes, but finally fell. Then, the other monsters began to attack.
It did not take long for the other monsters to suffer the same fate. ......

I think that's it... o Is this the last of them? Is this the last one?

Tiket throws the treasure chest on the floor. One after another, treasure chests and long chests were found, and Teeke was stunned to find that the treasure chests and long chests were all in the same place.
In a sort of amazement, she gathered all of them in one place.

In all, there were about 8 (eight) pieces. It was the first time Teeke had ever found so many treasure chests in one room.
It was the first time for Teeke to find so many treasure chests in one room. On the upper floor was the castle, where she found armories and treasuries, but she had never seen so many treasure chests in one room.
On the upper floor, there was a castle with an armory and a treasure room, but there were no treasure chests there, just the items arranged as they were in the room.
There is no treasure chest.

Teeke was bitten in front of the pile of treasure chests. Experientially, it is a good idea to keep a good eye on what is in the treasure chest.
He knew from experience that what was in the treasure chest was a good item.

He inserted the excalibur between the lids and used all his weight to pry the hoard open.
This was a very difficult task for Teeke, who had to use all his strength to pry it open. This was unusual for Teeke. I usually kick open treasure chests.
But he had to kick open the treasure chest. It would have been easier to pry it open with a sword or something with a sharp point, but he didn't want to use the holy sword for this.
But I don't feel comfortable using the holy sword for such a purpose.
Even I got tired of it. ...... J

I thought that since it was the Holy Sword of legend, it would not break or fall off.
Thinking casually that since it was a sacred sword of legend, it would not break or fall off, Teeke began to work on the next long chest. In no time at all, all the lids were opened.
In no time at all, all the lids were opened.

No (5). = (5) Pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass.

Tique took one item after another and began to sort through them. Guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns

There were a number of strong options, including the Treecheat Opus Passu, the Lincoln Knot dockyard, and the Ndjimoneua Mimom√£o Ring, but in the end Teeke chose the Scroll.
In the end, Teeke chose only a few scrolls.

He had all the others.
