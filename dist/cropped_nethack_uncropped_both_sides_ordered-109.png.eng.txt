I don't like the idea of being a bandit.

The screams of the fourteen year olds were leading them into a devil's cave.

Downstairs, Jositne had found a long chest.

Not an uncommon occurrence. On some floors, there are three or four chests or treasure chests.
The long chests were sometimes found on the first floor. The lock on the long chest was a square lock that required a key.
He did not have a key. So, he tried to kick it open as if it were a square.
He tried to kick it open, but this time he felt something on the edge. Hostility.
I could feel a hostility or what I would call a murderous intent from Changitsu.

It was this sense that had enabled him to survive as an adventurer. Yoshitane knew very well that this sense could not be ignored.

It was not in his nature.

For the past two moments, Yoshitsune had been sitting in front of the long chest, waiting to be set up.
(1) He was looking for the type of stay that might have been planted in the long chest.
(2) "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Yoshikine lay down on the floor. Without a doubt, Tou would be the one to do the trick.
I could only understand that Tou must have been planted. On the other hand, it took me a few moments to understand that the tao had been planted.

One way was to ignore the fact that the two were not in agreement and to kick them over. It is true that the parents would have acted.
The parents would act, but only what was inside could be accessed. However, if the animal burst into flames, it would be impossible to get to it.
But if the animal was going to burst into flames, it might as well be sleeping gas or a paralyzing poison needle.

Electricity, electrolysis, and electrolytic dissolution.
