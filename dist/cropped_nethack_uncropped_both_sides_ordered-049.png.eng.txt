That's why. We had already confirmed that it was Sook-yu's medicine, but the rest remained unidentified.
The other remained unidentified. The red, blue, and green liquid in the bottles were all very bright, but the color and the effect were not always in direct proportion.

The Nasr Nekhlalayu and the Sudhran melin are the only ones who can return the kyphosis.

Once he was sure of everything, Nasrullah stood up slowly. The next enemy awaited.
The next enemy was waiting.
