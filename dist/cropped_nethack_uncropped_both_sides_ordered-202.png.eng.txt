A leech ape, carnivorous ape

The baboon (ape) is a gigantic primate that may reach several meters in length. They are also a chimpanzee-eater.
Because they are carnivorous, they sometimes thatch their meat on the stomachs of their gastropods.

Baboons are often in groups that are led by a post. Therefore, even if one baboon
If one baboon gets one, there are probably several more waiting behind it. When the body strength is low, for example, it may be difficult for the fish to move.
This is a partner you need to be careful of when your strength is low. Do not play in the center of a large room.
Instead, you should try to lure them into a narrower space to fight. However, a baboon's weapons, other than its teeth, are only as weak as its claws.
However, the baboon's weaponry, other than its teeth, is limited to its meager claws, which would not be much of a threat to a well-equipped grievance hunter.
It should not be too intimidating for a well-equipped stomachic.

Carnivorous baboons (carnivorous ape) are a species of baboons that have long been carnivorous, but have become carnivorous as a result of their long history of feeding on meat.
The carnivorous ape is an omnivorous baboon that has become more frenzied due to its long history as a carnivore, and its body size is almost twice that of a normal baboon.
The Yerender baboons are particularly well-known for their aggressive behavior, especially in the area of the throat. The ones that live in the Yerender's cave are especially fond of human flesh.
They seem to be particularly fond of human flesh, so the unwary should beware. However, these are cosmetics.
However, they are less likely to act cosmetically and more likely to wander around as loners.
In general, they are easier to subdue than baboons because they are less likely to act under the covers and more likely to roam alone.
The baboons are often more likely to wander than normal baboons, and in general they are easier to knock down.

Baboon meat is considered to be one of the most delicious of all the monsters in Yerender's cave.

Buckeye bat, giant bat, vampire bat

The cormorant lives in the darkest of Yerender's grottoes. The grottoes are the caves of the Yenders and their lackeys.
The grotto is an artifact produced by Yender and his lackeys, but it seems to have settled on the surface.
It seems to have taken up residence on the surface.

When they see an unscrupulous intruder, they leap upon him with their tiny fangs to defend their territory.
They leap at them with their swords to defend their territory. However, because they are not very powerful, they are not easily repelled.
They would be easy to fight off. However, the behavior of the flying squirrels is not consistent.
I would like you to pay attention to that part alone. When they are close, they are far away; when they are close, they are far away; when they are close, they are close.
The fact that they approach when you think they are approaching makes them extremely difficult to target.

The vyampire bat is basically the same as the giant cormorant.
