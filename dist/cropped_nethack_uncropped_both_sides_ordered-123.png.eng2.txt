How can you save money?”

Shoshinne tried to make a lighthearted comment, but it turned out that he couldn't have said something like that right away.
I noticed something. I couldn't find anything resembling a door in the small vault.
That's it. Only the gold coins that have piled up so much exist.
Ru.

Shoshone tried hard to find a hidden door, but every wall seemed to be nothing more than a wall.
It was. About half an hour passed, but the door did not seem to appear.
``This is no joke!'' Are you trapped in a place like this?''

While yelling, Yoshine pounded on the wall with all her might. The pain will come, but...
Shittsune didn't pay any attention to this and continued banging on the wall. Don't be defeated by a monster
Anyway, I'm stuck in a small room like this, and I'm still waiting for a book to die.
It's very far from here.

And at that time. The wall opened and a man appeared.
``Huh? That's an unfamiliar face, who is it?''

The moment Shoshone looked up, the man raised his voice.
``My name is Yoshine, a samurai...''
`Shoshine? This is my first time hearing it. Whose permission did you get to get into this safe? Everything.
I want you to throw your goldfish on the floor and come after me. If you do that, let me get you out of here.
"Ru"

There was no way Shoshin had any objections. There are also gold coins that he had from before.
There were some in the area, but it's cheap compared to what would rot in a place like this.
I haven't reached the end yet.

However, the moment I was about to take my wallet out of my pack. Yoshitune is a typical feeling
I noticed that something was rising up from deep within my body.

There was a head of Killer Bee in front of the store. Then, a roar echoed from somewhere.
stomach
``They're thieves! They have teleport abilities!''

Shoshine was listening to Kirabipi's voice even as he was using his great sword.

Apparently, the canned food contained the meat of a monster that had teleportation abilities.
It's late. That ability was transferred to Shoshitsune.
