I met a man named Deiores.

He lived under a bridge near the favela. He lived under a bridge just outside the favela, in an abaraya that he was afraid to call home.
His home was an abaraya, a kind of abaraya that I would be hesitant to call a home. A warrior as active as he was would have had a house as grand as he wished.
A warrior of his stature should have been able to build as grand a house as he wished. But the very spirit of the man himself was not the same,
But would his very spirit have wanted him to live in a place with such a name?

The place I intend to visit is the home of a man named Deiores.
5,.

Until a few years ago, he was a well-known barrier barrier. He was proud of his great size, and with a great sword in his hand, he could cut down everything.
He used to brag that he could cut through everything with the great sword in his hand.

He was so proud of his great size that he claimed to be able to cut through everything with the great sword in his hand.
He was a man of great strength.

Although he was unable to obtain an amulet from Yender, Dioreth was able to find a way to escape from the grotto.
Although he was unable to break free of the enchantment, De Ores returned from the grotto.

She returned with many treasures.

If only that had been the case, he would have been a hero.
But he did not.

However, today's Diores is much further away from such a bush.
The first is (1), the second is (8), the third is (9), and the fourth is (10).

When he crawled out of the cave, his muscles were so full that they could not be cut through steel.
When he crawled out of the cave, his muscles, which had been so full that they could have cut through steel, had atrophied to the point of being useless.

Her chestnut-colored hair, which had been the object of envy from many of her daughters, had turned gray.
Her chestnut hair, which had been looked upon with envy by many of her daughters, had turned gray.

Her eyes had lost their sparkle and were now colored with fear. The words that spilled out of his mouth made no sense.
The words coming from So did not make any sense.

What fear had seized him, I, who am not God, have no reason to know.

But there was a place of fear, a place of sharpness, a place of peace.

The spirit of Deiolis had been shattered in the cave of Ye-Ender. Since then, he has been holed up in this cabin.
Since then, they have holed themselves up in these huts, cut off from human contact, and lived in the darkness. Sometimes he would go out into the city.
Sometimes he would go out into the city and sell the treasures he had acquired in Yender's cave for two or three thousand rupees, and then live off the money.
