The only thing we can rely on is our own strength to get to the next level.
It is only our own strength that we can rely on. !
Teeke shouted as she attacked Mommy.

Teeke soon realized that her inexperience had caused Anded's turn to fail.
But that's another story.

Tugendered is a special skill that only Freist and Kajot possess. A spell with the same name can be found in many places in the world.
Although there are spells with the same name, they have the same effect and can destroy an android's android.
The spell can be used to destroy an android's android. However, the spells can only be used a limited number of times, but the two classes listed above can be used a limited number of times.
The difference is that the two classes above have an innate ability to be used an unlimited number of times.
The two classes differ in that they have an innate ability and can be used as many times as they wish without limit. The Wanyo Pastet Koominck-Kut and the Wanyo Pastet Koominck-Kut are the most common.
The only purpose of the "K" is to scare the anded into running away, which is not the same as a power or a spell.
It is different from powers and spells.

The effects of the taunts are only effective on visible and dead bodies. If they are inside the room, they will not be able to see it.
If they are inside a house, all of the respondents are targeted, but if they are in a passageway where they can only see one step ahead, they can only see their neighbors.

It is not possible.

The success of a successful turn to break the anddeed is dependent on the success of the turn.
The distance between Makuku's empirire and R-Ku's gunjore is a few levels less than the distance between Makuku's empirire and R-Ku's gunjore.
Against the andedges, Tern almost always succeeds. The higher andeds are not tolerated by Tern.
The higher the level difference, the more the success rate decreases.
The success rate decreases as the gap between the two levels widens.

However, if a turn is successful, no experience value is gained, and the number of successful turns is limited by the number of times a turn can be broken.
Only one body can be destroyed in a single turn, and the only ones who can turn are those who are more likely to be able to turn than themselves.
The only ones that can turn are the ones that can be broken in a few more turns than themselves, and the ones that can turn reliably are the ones that are at level T and the ones that can be broken in a few more turns than themselves.
It may be better to leave the country and go to Europe. The blessed weapon is an undecided weapon.
If you have a blessed weapon, you can use it to protect yourself and your family.
